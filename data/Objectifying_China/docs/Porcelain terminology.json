In the West, the term porcelain refers specifically to white ceramics made with a special type of clay called kaolin and fired to a temperature of about $1 3 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , which results in a translucent, glassy material that makes a ringing sound when struck. Stoneware is used to refer to related ceramics that are similarly hard and dense, but which are made with grey or brown clay, may or may not be white-bodied, do not transmit light, and are fired to a slightly lower temperature of 1000 to $1 2 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . Ceramics fired below this temperature range are called earthenwares. The terms ‘protoporcelain’ or ‘porcellaneous’ are sometimes used to describe early ceramics made with some of the same ingredients and physical characteristics of porcelain.",
