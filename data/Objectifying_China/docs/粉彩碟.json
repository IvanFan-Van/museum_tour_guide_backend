Some of the most famous of these include qingbai (‘green-white’), a translucent porcelain with a bluish-green glaze produced at kiln complexes in Jingdezhen and Jizhou, and celadon, a type of porcelain or stoneware with an olive-green glaze that takes its name from a character with a distinctive outfit in L’Astrée, a seventeenthcentury French comedy.15 Similar in colour to valuable jade, these ceramics were among the most highly regarded in China—particularly celadon from the Longquan kilns in Lishui, Zhejiang province, which supplied the Southern Song court after the collapse of the northern dynasty in 1127. Today, some scholars prefer the term ‘greenware’ for these ceramics to avoid using arbitrary Western nomenclature.  \n\nChinese qingbai and celadon wares were also exported to East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Islamic world—where the latter was thought to break or change colour if touched by poison. They were most eagerly collected in regions situated firmly within China’s sphere of cultural and political influence, such as Japan. Song dynasty celadon shipped from Ningbo in Zhejiang province to Japan. During the Kamakura period (1185–1333), celadon became the favoured form of utensils and interior decoration for the Japanese tea ceremony, and formed part of a fashion for karamono (‘Chinese things’), attested to by the thousands of shards recovered from historic sites and many intact examples preserved in major Japanese temples.  \n\nIn Korea, refined Chinese celadon pieces brought to the imperial court by official embassies in the Goryeo period (918–1392) were seen as the pinnacle of ceramic artistry. Local potters were soon making their own versions, combining stylistic elements drawn directly from Chinese wares as well as new designs articulated for Korean consumers. And in Mainland Southeast Asia, green-glazed ceramics reminiscent of celadon were among the first stonewares to be produced, 在十四世紀青花瓷盛行前的數百年，中國北方 與南方的大型窯場以製造藍、綠和白色等不 同色調的刻花上釉瓷或炻器為主。其中最著 名的，包括青白瓷和青瓷。前者是一種產於景 德鎮和吉州窯的藍綠釉半透明瓷器，後者則 為一種施橄欖綠色釉的的瓷器或炻器，其英文 celadon，得名於十七世紀法國喜劇《牧羊女亞 絲泰萊》中，一名身穿綠衣的人物「雪拉同」 (Celadon)。15 色澤近乎翡翠的青白瓷和青瓷，在 境內備受推崇，尤其是在一一二七年北宋滅亡 後，為南宋宮廷供應陶瓷的浙江省麗水市龍泉 窯的青瓷。部分當代學者為了更準確地命名這 類陶瓷器，會以 greenware( 綠釉陶瓷 ) 來表示 青白瓷和青瓷。  \n\n中國青白瓷和青瓷亦是流行的外銷瓷品種，市場遍及東亞、東南亞及伊斯蘭世界。當時的伊斯蘭世界更認為若青瓷碰到毒藥，就會裂開或變色。在深受中國文化與政治勢力影響的地區如日本，青瓷受到熱烈追捧。在日本的謙倉時代 (1185-1333)，宋代青瓷從浙江省寧波運至日本，成為日本茶道者所喜愛的食具和室內陳設，同時掀起一陣「唐物」風潮──在歷史遺跡所發掘到的碎片、和日本各大寺廟中保存完好的青瓷，即為明證。  \n\n在韓國的高麗皇朝 (918-1392)，經外交使節傳入高麗宮廷的精緻中國青瓷，被視為陶瓷工藝的巔峰之作。高麗的陶匠隨即加以模仿，製作出混合中式風格和高麗本地色彩的青瓷。在東南亞大陸，與青瓷相似的綠釉陶瓷是當地首款採用中國燒窯技術，以較高溫度燒製而成的炻器。在十三世紀至十四世紀，越南紅河三角洲沿岸設有許多燒造綠釉陶瓷的窯場。十五世紀的宋加洛窯是最著名的，其出產的陶瓷更成為泰國早期最重要的出口商品之一。  \n\nusing kiln technologies from China that allowed ceramics to be fired at much higher temperatures. They were made at a number of sites in Vietnam along the Red River Delta during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and most famously at Sawankhalok in the fifteenth century, when they formed one of the early Thai kingdom’s most important export commodities.  \n\nCeladon was never sent to Europe in significant numbers, nor were they ever made with Western consumers in mind. The rare examples that did arrive were diplomatic gifts from rulers in the Islamic world, which were sometimes given elaborate metalwork mounts. Only three surviving Chinese ceramic pieces can be documented as reaching Europe before 1500: the Fonthill Vase (now in Dublin), which is qingbai; a Longquan celadon dish presented to Lorenzo de’ Medici by the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt in 1487; and the ‘Katzenelnbogen bowl’, bought by an aristocratic German pilgrim in the Holy Land in 1433–1434, who on his return had it given a cover and mounts in gilded silver.  \n\nThis absence was most likely the result of changing fashions in Asia. By the time Europe began direct trade with China in the sixteenth century, celadon wares had largely been supplanted in the domestic market by blue-and-white porcelain. Established kilns that had focused on celadon before the fourteenth century turned their attention to the production of blue-and-white wares—although some—such as the kilns in Longquan, Cizhou and Jizhou—continued to produce celadon and other monochromatic ceramics in smaller quantities, and Song examples remained popular among collectors in later periods.  \n\n只有少量的青瓷外銷至歐洲，更鮮有是專為歐洲市場而設的。傳入歐洲的罕有例子，是由伊斯蘭世界的統治者所贈的外交禮物，當地人偶爾會為這些青瓷鑲嵌上華麗的金屬。現存有紀錄、於一五零零年前抵達歐洲的中國陶瓷，只有三件，包括「豐山瓶」青白瓷 ( 現藏於都柏林 )；由埃及馬木路克蘇丹國的蘇丹，於一四八七年贈予羅倫左．德麥地奇的龍泉窯青瓷碟；及在一四三三至三四年，由德國貴族朝聖先輩從聖地攜回的「卡策內爾恩博根碗」，當時該件青瓷已加蓋、並鑲有銀飾。  \n\n這段青瓷的「空白期」應該與亞洲的流行風尚有所轉變相關。到了十六世紀，當歐洲直接與中國進行商業貿易後，本地市場上的青瓷已被青花瓷取代。雖然當時部分的窯場，如龍泉窯、磁州窯和吉州窯，仍持續生產少量的青瓷和其他單色釉器，而宋代青瓷仍受往後各朝的古物收藏家所青睞；但大部分在十四世紀前、專注於燒製青瓷的窯場，已轉向生產青花瓷。  \n\n15. Qingbai is also referred to as yingqing (‘shadow green’), although this name appears only to date from the eighteenth century. Other theories for the origin of celadon suggest that the name is a corruption of ‘Saladin’, the Ayyubid Sultan, who in 1171 sent forty pieces of the ceramic to the Sultan of Syria, or that it derives from the Sanskrit words sila and dhara, which mean ‘green’ and ‘stone’.  \n\n15. 在十八世紀，青白瓷也稱作「影青 」。 另 有 理 論 指 出，celadon 一字可能是埃宥比王朝的蘇丹「薩拉丁」(Saladin) 的訛傳。這位薩拉丁於一一七一年，曾下令運送四十件陶瓷予敘利亞的蘇丹。另一說法則認為celadon 可能源自梵文 silan 及 dhara，即「綠色」和「石頭」。  \n\n![](objectifying_china/54_1.jpeg)",
