In the 1720s, the Meissen factory developed a new and extensive range of enamel colours, and the factory’s painters excelled in fantastic depictions of life in an imagined Far East. These successes were soon followed by the founding of a second factory in Vienna by Claudius du Paquier, assisted by the former kiln master from Meissen, which began making hard-paste porcelain by about 1719. A number of other factories opened in Germany in the 1740s and ’50s, often with workers from Meissen or Vienna who provided the necessary technical expertise.  \n\nThe discoveries in Meissen were followed by the establishment of major factories elsewhere in Europe. In Italy, where softpaste porcelain (an imitation, low-fired porcelain that lacked the ingredients found in hard-paste porcelain) had been made at the Medici workshops since the late sixteenth century, Francesco Vezzi established a porcelain factory in Venice that began producing hard-paste porcelain in significant numbers in 1720. Experiments by the Marchese Carlo Ginori led to the development of a hard-paste porcelain factory in Doccia, near Florence in 1737, which produced works inspired by delicate white wares from Dehua (fig. 7). Both men were assisted by workers from the Du Paquier factory, and Doccia porcelain from the 1740s sometimes features painted decoration that reflects the influence of Du Paquier porcelain—demonstrating the atmosphere of technological and stylistic exchange that characterised the European ceramic industry of the eighteenth century.  \n\nKaolin was not discovered in France until the second half of the eighteenth century, and all French porcelain produced before 1770 was soft- rather than hard-paste. Both types were first made in factories which had previously produced the most common ceramic product of the time—faience, a type of tin-glazed earthenware—like those in Rouen and SaintCloud. Perhaps the most successful of these was at Sèvres in the western part of Paris, which had moved from its former premises in Vincennes in 1756. With the financial backing of King Louis XV (r. 1715–1774), the Sèvres factory soon came to dominate not only the French ceramic industry, but also the entirety of European ceramics for the second half 地奇工作坊燒造軟質瓷 ( 一種以低溫燒製、且 缺乏製成硬質瓷原材料的仿瓷器 ) 的意大利， 法蘭西斯科．韋爾於一七二零年在威尼斯建立 工廠，大量生產硬質瓷。馬切斯．卡羅．基諾 里的實驗使位於佛羅倫斯附近的多西亞瓷廠於 一七三七年得以成立，並以生產靈感源於精緻 的德化白瓷之硬質瓷 ( 圖 7)。韋爾和基諾里均 得到都帕契爾工廠的工人協助，故一七四零年 代出產的多西亞瓷器的彩繪裝飾，偶爾折射出 都帕契爾瓷器的特色──展現出十八世紀歐洲 陶瓷工業之間的工藝和風格交流之氛圍。  \n\n直到十八世紀下半葉，法國才發現高嶺土，故一七七零年前燒造的法國瓷器，都是軟質瓷而非硬質瓷。燒造兩種瓷器的瓷廠，昔日都是以生產當時最普遍的彩陶──一種塗上錫釉的陶器為主，就如盧昂和聖克盧的作坊一樣。其中最成功的，可能是巴黎西部的塞爾夫工廠。該廠於一七五六年從萬塞訥的舊址搬遷至此。在法國國王路易十五 ( 執政年份為 1715 年至 1774年 ) 的經濟支持下，塞爾夫工廠不但迅速獨霸法國的陶瓷工業，更主導十八世紀下半葉的歐洲陶瓷工業發展。塞爾夫工廠持續發展創新與進行改革實驗，又追尋各種創作靈感，如日本漆器 ( 圖 8)。故此，塞爾夫工廠在一七五零年代中葉，就產量與創新層面，已取代邁森工廠成為十八世紀歐洲陶瓷生產的先鋒。  \n\n![](objectifying_china/11_2.jpeg)\n\nSweetmeat dish.
