Depictions of qilin were relatively rare before the seventeenth century, but became more popular during the reign of the Shunzhi emperor. They were usually depicted with the head of a dragon, the body of a deer (but scaled), the hooves of a goat and the tail of a Buddhist ‘lion-dog’. The treatment of the banana plant to the right of the qilin is consistent with those found on other blue-and-white wares dated to the mid-seventeenth century, such as an almost identical plate from the Gerald Reitlinger collection of the Ashmolean Museum (acc. no. 1778.888), and a number of fragments in the Metropolitan Museum of Art that were recovered from the wreck of the Nuestra Señora de la Maravillas, a Spanish treasure galleon sunk in 1656.  \n\nThe glazed base is incised with the four-character mark of yutang jiaqi (‘fine vessel for the jade hall’). The Jade Hall, also known as Hanlin Academy, was an official bureau made up of scholars who attained the highest degrees essential for reaching office in dynastic China. Such marks appear to have been a symbol of status and were used only occasionally in the late Ming period. They became more fashionable in the Shunzhi era, before falling out of favour during the reign of the Kangxi emperor.",
