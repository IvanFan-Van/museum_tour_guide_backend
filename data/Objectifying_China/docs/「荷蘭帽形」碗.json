Klapmuts bowls appear extensively in Dutch East India Company shipping records, as well as in paintings, the earliest dating to 1601.  \n\n此器深腹，敞口，是外銷瓷的特色。寬闊的碗口據湯碗的造型而設計，方便配合使用西方的金屬大湯匙。這類瓷碗專為荷蘭市場而設，荷蘭語稱為 klapmuts，即一款與這款瓷碗形狀相似、流行於十七世紀的荷蘭帽子。荷蘭東印度公司的船務紀錄及荷蘭繪畫中也常有相關的記錄，最早的可追溯至一六零一年。  \n\n![](objectifying_china/23_1.jpeg)",
