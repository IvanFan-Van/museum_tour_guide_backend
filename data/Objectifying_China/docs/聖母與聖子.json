Demonstrating their appeal among the noble houses of Europe, dated inventories show that figures of a woman and child, probably representing Guanyin, were also in the Dresden porcelain collection of Augustus II the Strong, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony (1670–1733), as well as in the smaller collection of William III, King of England (r. 1689–1702) and Queen Mary II (r. 1689–1694) at Kensington House, London.  \n\n一艘於一六九九年從廈門返回英國的「拿素」號貨船的銷售清單，即記有承載三十九座、可能如這座聖母與聖子像的聖母瑪利亞像 ( 並有一百七十座相關的「婦人與孩子」像 )。與觀音像相關的「婦人與孩子」像令歐洲貴族著迷，並加以收藏；如波蘭國王薩克森選侯奧古斯特二世(1670-1733) 的德勒斯登瓷器收藏、英格蘭國王威廉三世( 執政年份為 1689 年至 1702 年 ) 與女王瑪麗二世 ( 執政年份為 1689 年至 1694 年 ) 的倫敦肯辛頓宮，均有收藏此類瓷器。",
