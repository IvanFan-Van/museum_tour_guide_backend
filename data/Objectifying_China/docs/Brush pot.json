After use, they were rinsed and stored in the pot with their handle down so that the bundles of hair would keep their shape. They formed a significant proportion of the scholarly objects made at the imperial kilns during the Kangxi period, probably because of the emperor’s interest in calligraphy. The literati valued beauty inspired by nature, a preference vividly reflected in the objects they displayed in their studios, whether in the choice of shapes, materials or decorative themes.  \n\nLiterati objects like brush pots occasionally made their way into European collections via other markets. They were often repurposed, and it was not unusual to find brush pots in Europe being used as flowerpots. Some may have been acquired in Southeast Asia, where objects made for the literati were imported and collected by overseas Chinese merchants who turned to scholarly pursuits in their spare time.",
