This colour was achieved in much the same way as the deep-brown glaze used on the previous bowl, but with a lesser amount of iron-oxide added during the firing process. Café au lait porcelain was commonly over-decorated with coloured enamels on arrival in Europe. In Germany, wheel-engraving, in which craftsmen removed sections of the glaze to expose the white porcelain beneath in controlled patterns, was another technique used to enliven these objects.",
