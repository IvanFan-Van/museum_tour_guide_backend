It is decorated with a scene in cobalt blue underglaze depicting a man with a shaved pate standing among pavilions and banana plant leaves. Wearing a water-proof cape, he may be a hunter or outdoorsman.

By the early seventeenth-century substantial quantities of Chinese ceramics made with obvious surface flaws (described positively as mushikui, ‘worm-eaten’ in Japanese) began to be made specifically for this market.
