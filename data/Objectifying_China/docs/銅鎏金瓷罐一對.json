The powder blue porcelain vessels have an elegant, undulating profile. The elaborate gilded bronze mounts, which show dragons, were finely sculpted, cast and gilded in France, likely during the reign of Louis XV (1710–1774). Imported wares were often mounted with extravagant gilt-bronze settings, which adopted the stylistic vocabulary and fantastic forms of French rococo, while also making unfamiliar Chinese forms more useable in European interiors. Merchants called marchands-merciers, who specialised in marketing luxury objects, facilitated the addition of such mounts to porcelain, drawing on extensive networks of silversmiths, craftsmen and decorators.  \n\nThis pair of vessels demonstrates the high regard for fine Chinese porcelain at the European courts. In France, the earliest recorded Chinese (blue-and-white) ceramic object reached the court of Henry II (1519–1559) via Constantinople, a gift from Suleiman the Magnificent (1494–1566), Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Further gifts presented by the Siamese ambassador Phra Narai (1633– 1688) to Louis XIV (1638–1715) in 1686, and objects imported by the French East India Company (since 1664) helped spread a fashion for such exotica.
