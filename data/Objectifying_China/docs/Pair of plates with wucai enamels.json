First developed during the reign of the Jiajing emperor, the production of wucai porcelain flourished in the Wanli period. These emperors commissioned a variety of porcelain objects decorated in this style, made in both the imperial kilns and private commercial enterprises. These plates, decorated on the interior with an imperial five-clawed dragon and marked on the base with the reign marks of the Wanli emperor, may be one such example.  \n\nDespite the name, wucai porcelain could be decorated with fewer or more than five colours. Ming dynasty enamelling techniques allowed for some variety in tone, but gradations in colour and shading were limited. Innovations in the Kangxi period, such as the addition of opaque white (derived from lead arsenate) and transparent ruby enamel (from colloidal gold), led to the development of new variations of wucai, such as famille rose, which were highly prized in Europe.",
