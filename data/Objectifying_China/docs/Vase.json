    "document": "# Vase  \n\nJingdezhen, China (Qing dynasty), Kangxi period, 1662–1722 Porcelain with underglaze blue, height 46.3 cm HKU.C.1964.0289  \n\nThe decoration on this vase depicts figures (probably scholars with attendants) standing in a mountainous landscape with waterfalls, rivers and pine and prunus trees. Scenes which alluded to the lives of the literati became popular during the transitional period, as ceramic production for the court declined, and the literati-gentry, merchants and export market became their most important patrons. Potters had easy access to models, with scenes of the literati used widely on woodblock prints, painting manuals and various luxury goods. More than merely decorative, they presented a contemporary portrait of society and acted as a form of political commentary. There is an element of theatricality to the scenery here, with humble fishermen shown eking out a living on the water with the lofty retreats of the scholarly elite high above.  \n\nThe shape of the vase is modelled after archaic bronze wine vessels called gu first produced in the Shang (ca. 1600–1050 BCE) and Zhou (ca. 1046–256 BCE) dynasties. The round mid-section, distinct from the more angular mid-sections of the ancient gu , is a feature of late Shunzhi and early Kangxi vases. The basic forms of antiquarian objects like gu had been absorbed into the repertory of the Jingdezhen potters by the Kangxi period, and were used widely for a variety of purposes; however, the pairing of the shape with literati subject matter on this vase suggests that it was chosen deliberately to appeal to the scholarly class.",
