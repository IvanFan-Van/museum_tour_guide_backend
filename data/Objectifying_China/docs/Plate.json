The reddish-brown earthenware was glazed with tin oxide, which resulted in a white outer layer after firing. Delft designers were better able to match the appearance of Chinese export ceramics in their surface decoration. They boast a wide variety of designs including floral motifs, animals, landscapes, family crests and religious subjects. This plate is decorated with a stag amidst flowering plants, a well-known design on seventeenth century kraak ware.",
