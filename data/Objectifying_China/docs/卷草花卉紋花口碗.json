Their icy blue-green tinge was produced by applying a glaze with small amounts of iron to a fine porcelain stone and kaolin clay body, which was fired in an oxygen deprived atmosphere. The colour of their glazes ranged from a very thin and pale white to a pale bluegreen that is often associated with celadon.

Though not generally made for the imperial court, they were appreciated by Song connoisseurs, such as the ceramic historian Jiang Qi who likened qingbai to jade in his Tao ji (‘Records on Ceramics’), written between 1214–1234. Valuable export items, their popularity with various trading communities in Java is mentioned in Zhao Rugua’s (1170– 1231) Zhufanzhi (‘A Description of Barbarian Nations, Records of Foreign People’), a thirteenth-century document which describes foreign customs and commodities traded in South East Asia and the Indian Ocean during the Song dynasty.  \n\n為迎合本地需求，青白瓷的款式豐富多樣，既有碗碟、茶壺等日用器，亦有精緻的人物塑像和罐等明器。雖然青白瓷一般不屬御器，卻深受宋代鑑賞家的喜愛；如陶瓷史學家蔣祈所著的《陶記》(1214-1234)，曾將青白瓷比喻成美玉。宋趙汝适 (1170-1231) 的《諸蕃志》──一本成書於十三世紀，記錄東南亞與印度洋等域外貢品與商品貿易的著作中，亦提及青白瓷深受爪哇各地的商旅歡迎。  \n\n![](objectifying_china/55_1.jpeg)",
