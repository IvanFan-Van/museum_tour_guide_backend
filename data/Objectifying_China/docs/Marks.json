    "document": "# Marks  \n\nMany different marks can be found on Chinese porcelain. The most prevalent in this catalogue are imperial marks that occur on pieces for the court and related institutions from the Ming dynasty onwards. They usually consist of six characters (sometimes four) in two rows that are read from right to left and from top to bottom, or in seal script within a square. The first two characters indicate the dynasty (for instance Da Ming, ‘the great Ming dynasty’). The next two give the reign name (nian hao) of the ruling emperor, for instance Jiajing, or Wanli. The last two characters mean ‘made during the period of ’ (nian zhi). This tradition was continued during the Qing dynasty. Imperial Ming and Qing marks also occur on non–imperial wares and even on export porcelain.  \n\nOther character marks and seal marks may have many different meanings: a wish for good luck, a date, a quality comparison, an owner or factory, or an indication for use in a specific setting.  \n\nIndividual potter's marks are rare on Jingdezhen porcelain, but they occur much more frequently on porcelain from Dehua. Marks are usually found on the bottom of a piece, sometimes on the edge or shoulder, or in the centre.",
