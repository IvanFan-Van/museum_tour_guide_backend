They typically have a bulbous body, a neck which is used for holding the vessel and a spout. This example is incised with a scrolling floral pattern that was popular from the Tang dynasty onwards. Used in Southeast Asia from at least as early as the ninth century, they found less utility in China, and were instead made in porcelain from about the fourteenth century for markets in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, shipped from the ports of Quanzhou and Fuzhou.  \n\nBy the sixteenth century, they were carried farther afield to the Middle East, where Persian copies were made and sometimes adapted for use as waterpipes for smoking tobacco. They were also brought to Europe via Portuguese and Dutch traders in the seventeenth century, where they were used as curiosities and decorative items rather than as functional vessels. Substantial quantities were recovered from the Witte Leeuw (1613) and the Hatcher Cargo (1643)—the remains of vessels carrying goods intended for Dutch-controlled Batavia, from where they would have been transported to other ships sailing for Europe.",
