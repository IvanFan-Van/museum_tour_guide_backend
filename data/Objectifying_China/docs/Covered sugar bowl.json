But few of the craftsmen who decorated these objects had ever been to China, and their imaginations resulted in landscapes, people and animals that audiences in China would have barely recognised, such as the pagodas and trees depicted with hatched and cross-hatched lines on this bowl. Combining Asian motifs with Western embellishments, the twisted handles with moulded leaf appliqués were inspired by contemporary rococo designs on ceramics and metalwares. The bowl is made of pearlware, a greyish earthenware with a blue-tinted glaze made in several English factories as a substitute for Chinese porcelain.",
