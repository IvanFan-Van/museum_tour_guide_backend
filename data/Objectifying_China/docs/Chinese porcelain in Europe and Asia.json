He called them porcelanna, Italian for a white seashell, and this soon became the standard term in Europe. But China had been producing porcelain of the highest quality for markets across the globe long before the arrival of Europeans. From the sixth to twentieth centuries, Chinese kilns produced everything from magnificent display pieces for the imperial court to vast quantities of bowls, plates and dishes intended for everyday use and for export to Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The appeal of these works lay not just in their technical achievement, but also in their association with Chinese art and culture, long viewed as a source of learning, tradition and vast wealth.  \n\nThe first Chinese porcelains arrived in Europe in the fourteenth century, when small numbers were presented as rare gifts to the ruling houses of Europe via intermediaries in the Middle East (fig. 1). Delicate, nearly transparent and resistant to extreme heat and moisture, they were technologically superior to the thick, low-fired European ceramics made before the eighteenth century, and were regarded as objects of great rarity and luxury. Their construction was so poorly understood that European collectors often had them mounted in gilt silver or gold in a manner similar to naturalia (‘natural wonders’) like ostrich eggs and large shells, which emphasised their preciousness and transformed them into entirely different objects. They were often displayed in cabinets of curiosities: collections of extraordinary objects which, like today's museums, attempted to categorise and tell stories about the wonders of the natural world (fig. 2).  \n\nBy the early sixteenth century—after Portugal established trade routes to the Far East and began commercial trade with Asia via Portuguese-controlled ports in Macau, Malacca and Dejima—porcelain became an important component of the wider trade in silk, spices, tea, ivory, metalwork and lacquer between East and West. Major production centres like Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province responded to demand in Europe by producing large amounts of porcelain specifically for export, transported and used as a form of ballast in large merchant ships. New arrivals like the Dutch and British built",
