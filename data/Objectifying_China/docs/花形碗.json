Fujian, a tea-growing region, attracted the attention of European merchants in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and many of these objects were brought back to Europe, where this type of white Dehua porcelain became known as blanc de Chine (French for ‘white of China’). They were also exported to Japan in large quantities.  \n\nDehua specialised in whitewares, the most highly prized were those with an ivory-coloured glaze. References in seventeenthcentury literary sources note that the translucent appearance of Dehua whitewares was the result of ‘truly fine’ porcelain stone that was dug by driving a shaft into the side of a nearby hill, from where the material was then pulled out with a rope. The earliest pieces of Dehua porcelain were made of this locally mined porcelain stone, with little or no clay, and were thinly potted. Unlike Jingdezhen, the Dehua kilns had no access to water transportation and until the arrival of foreign merchants most of its products were sold locally.  \n\nThe most common types of Dehua products were incense burners and Buddhist figures moulded and finished by hand. In China, these were usually placed on household altars and the latter were worshipped as devotional images. They were also brought to Europe as exotic curiosity items during the seventeenth century, where they were placed on tables and cabinets in the residences of aristocrats and wealthy people, or exhibited in ‘porcelain rooms’.  \n\nBy the eighteenth century, Europeans were familiar with Chinese polychrome ceramics. Dehua wares simply may have been seen as too plain by comparison, and many were gilded or enamelled in Europe to make them more attractive to customers. The Dehua kilns also produced objects tailored for the European market, including figures of Dutch men and women and Christian figures. These wares were closely copied at European porcelain factories, such as Meissen, Chantilly and Bow.  \n\n極為精緻、色澤均勻的白瓷產自中國南部福建省德化窯。作為產茶地區，福建於十六及十七世紀早已受到歐洲商人的青睞，所製的瓷器亦被大量運返歐洲。德化白瓷馳名中外，被譽為「中國白」( 法語為 blanc de Chine)。  \n\n德化窯擅長燒製一種備受推崇的象牙白釉瓷。據十七世紀的文獻記載，半透光的德化白瓷是以「極優質」的瓷石製造。工匠會先將在窯場附近山坡覓得的瓷石鏟起，再用繩索拉出。最早的德化瓷就是利用這種本地開採的瓷石製造，並混合少量陶土 ( 甚至不用陶土 )，故白瓷胎質纖巧。有別於景德鎮，德化窯並無水路交通，故在海外商旅踏足此地前，德化窯的產品多為本地銷售。  \n\n德化窯最常見的產品包括香爐和以人手塑造的佛像。不僅作為本地家居祭壇的器具和人民膜拜的對象，這些器物於十七世紀更外銷至歐洲，被當地人視為奇珍異物，成為貴族和富裕家庭的桌子和櫥櫃裝飾品、或「陶瓷室」陳列品。  \n\n當歐洲人在十八世紀接觸到更多中國彩瓷後，相比之下，德化白瓷顯得過分淡雅。故此，白瓷傳入歐洲後，多添加金屬鑲飾或琺瑯彩裝飾，以吸引客人購買。德化窯亦會為歐洲市場度身訂造瓷器，如荷蘭男女塑像、基督教聖像。當時歐洲的瓷廠，特別是邁森、尚蒂伊和博屋等都爭相模仿製造白瓷。",
