    "document": "LUI Shou- kwan (LÜ Shoukun, 1919- 1975) \nHong Kong Landscape \n1964 \nHorizontal scroll, \nink on paper, \n94.8 x 183.8 cm \nHKUP.2002.1410 \nThe careful composition of this landscape, which vanishes at the point where sky meets sea, contrasts emptiness with rugged reality through the use of dry and wet strokes. At the bottom, a long inscription discusses the artist's friendship with the connoisseur Hon-ki Chung. Lui acknowledges Chung as a close companion who discussed his paintings and encouraged Lui to pursue traditional techniques in the depiction of Hong Kong landscapes. \nLui Shou- kwan was born into a scholarly family in Guangzhou, Guangdong province. He moved to Hong Kong in 1948 and established himself as a pioneering painter in the local modern ink movement, which promoted new ink methods incorporating Western art elements that remained rooted in traditional Chinese tools and materials. \n1964 年 \nHKUP.2002.1410 \n\n",
