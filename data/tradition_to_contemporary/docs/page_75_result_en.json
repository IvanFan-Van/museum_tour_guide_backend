    "document": "LIN Jen-tong (LIN Jiantong, 1911-1994)\nand WANG Wenzhuo (1931-2000) \nPlum and Rock \n1976 \nHanging scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n127.4 x 67.7 cm \nGift of Baoguang Studio \nHKU.P.2006.1636 \nDelicate plum blossoms and buds adorn sharply-angled, gnarled branches in this collaborative work. They frame a large rock on the right, roughly outlined in a variety of ink strokes and washed with colour on suggest volumes. Each element conveys a wealth of auspicious meanings. Painted in pink and orange-red, the plum blossoms symbolise renewal and spring. They also represent longevity, as the words for plum and cherry now are homophonic on Chinese, evoking the bamboo eyebrows that develop in old age. The symbolism is reinforced by the artist's inscription, which reveals that the work was made to celebrate the seventy-eighth birthday of Chang Dai-chien (1899-1983), who taught both Lin and Wang. The inscription also delineates each artist's contribution to the work: Lin painted the plum blossoms and wrote the inscription after Wang Wenzhuo painted the rock during a celebration with colleagues, friends and relatives in honour of Chang Dai-chien. \nLin Jen-tong specialised in painting plum blossoms. He called himself a meichu, (someone obsessed with plum blossoms) and his studio name was 'the Owner of the Plum Blossom Study' (Mishouhuans zhuren). Wang Wenzhuo was the son of Wang Hanqiao (1914-2005) and a native of Chao'an. He moved to Hong Kong in 1936. Wang Hanqiao's name does appear on the painting, but it was donated to UMAG under his studio name, Baoguang shutang. \n1976 年 \nHKU.P.2006.1636 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_75_0.jpg)",
