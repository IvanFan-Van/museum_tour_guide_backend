    "document": "painted in 1930 and presented as a gift to Deng Erya (1884- 1954). The so- called White Benhong style is characterised by Huang's early preference for dry brushstrokes, light ink and sparse lines. The work was donated by Deng Erya's son Deng Zufeng and daughter- in- law Liang Huayi. It is difficult to find early works by Huang on the Matanlei, and this catalogue offers a rare chance to view a piece from this era.  \nIn addition, there is Wan Qingyi's Ancient People (cat. 68), in imitation of the style of Wang Meng (ca. 1308- 1385), one of the Four Masters, and Jun Tsung's A Par and Renew View of Streams and Mountain (cat. 31), which imitates Ni Zan's calligraphic style. These two masterful works exemplify the scholarly style, as well as the literal landscape model of painting. Wan Qingyi borrows from Wang Meng's lush compositions depicting waterfalls and cascades, and uses vigorous, forceful hemp- fiber strokes (pima ova) to create mountains of life, all of which is modelled on Wang's one- period paintings of layered peaks. Jun Tsung's painted Landscape when he was fifty, a period considered to be relatively early in his oeuvre from which few works still exist. His brushwork is dexterous and unrestrained, simple and unobtrusive, he utilises each- stopping strokes (pica ova) to show the texture of the mountains, which differs strikingly from his later more polished and nuanced style.  \nAmong the local landscape painters who worked in a traditional style are Liang Puky- Yien (1901- 1978), Lu Xiangfa (1868- 1970), Gui Dian (1865- 1958), Cen Guangyue (1876- 1960) and Au Kin- Kung (Ou Jiangong, 1886- 1971), who created seasonal landscapes, along with Joseph Lou Chunfu's (1916- 7) and others' archaic landscape paintings. For instance, Leung Puky- yue's light purple Landscapes of Four Seasons (cat. 20) is grounded in the traditional brush- and- ink painting style, with \nforceful lines that imitate the calligraphy of the Four Wangs' of the early Qing. In 1933, Joseph Lou Chunfu donated his Landscape After Wang Meng (cat. 22) to F S. Drake, professor of Chinese at HKU. Its dense composition and intense colors are closely representative of Wang Meng's typical style. \n## Remaking Tradition \nOf those who worked to remake tradition or to innovate within traditional landscape painting, Xu Beihong, Liu Hsun and Lu Shaoqi (1915- 2000) are among the best known on a national level; between local artists include Feng Zhaohong and Martina Pang (ca. 1940). Their works embody an attempt to locate opportunities for change within the tradition sometimes looking toward the West, but without losing sight of the norms of traditional Chinese ink painting, and paying close attention to brush- and- ink painting techniques. \nIn November 1938, Xu Beihong led an exhibition of his works at the Fung Ping Shan Library, after which he made the coloured ink painting Song of the Pipa (Pipa sang) (cat. 17) and decorated it to the Chinese Society of HKU. The picture is dedicated to HKU Chinese Department professor Ma Kaimin (Ma Jian, 1883- 1959) and signed by Xu in the twenty- seventh year of the Republic of China (1938). The painting was made during the Second Sino- Japanese War (1937- 1945), a period of great productivity for Xu. It was completed at the end of 1938, ten years after Xu had returned to China from his time in Europe (1919- 1927) and around the same time as his famous works Where There's a Wild, There's a Way and Portrait of Rabindranath Tagore. This was at a point when Xu's thought process and artistic style had matured. The Song of the Pipa (Pipa sang) was originally a folk- style poem by the Tang poet \n2 The dedication to Ma Jian made: \"In November of the 27th year, Ma Xu Beihong presented this painting to be included in the collection of a friend, and it was displayed at the Fung Ping Shan Library; that work was made for the Chinese Association in commemoration. . . . Ma Jian, Hong Kong.\" This documents that the exhibition was held in November 1938 at the Fung Ping Shan Library in Hong Kong. \n3 The father of Former HKU president Ma Lin, and once chairman of the HKU Chinese Department. \n\n",
