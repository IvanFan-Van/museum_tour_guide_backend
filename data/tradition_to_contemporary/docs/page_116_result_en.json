    "document": "Marina PANG (ca. 1940)  \nWinter Wonderland  \n1998  \nSet of four hanging scrolls, ink and colour on paper, 66 x 67.5 cm each Gift of the artist HKU.P.1999.1357 a-d  \nAn area of vibrant blue floating clouds on the right side of this landscape references its Chinese title: Liuli shijie (The Beryl World). The rest of the work is filled with a vast expanse of high mountain, cliffs and deep valleys in shades of ink and blue-green, demonstrating Marina Pang's mastery of colour. Pang contrasts these colours with areas of void in the form of waterfalls, white pine trees and the drifting clouds and mist that surround the mountains. In the foreground, tiny houses bring to mind the practices of noble, scholarly recluses. The English title for the work, Winter Wonderland, is a reference to the time of year when it was produced.  \nMarina Pang entered the world of Chinese painting through Pan Siu-yu (1893- 1983), who she met in 1970. Her early work focused on bird-and-flower paintings, which she studied from 1978 to 1983 with Chao Shao- an (1905- 1998). She is better known for her landscapes, developed under the tutelage of (Huang Junbi, 1898- 1991), which incorporate brushwork and splashed ink techniques learned from He Baili (b. 1945).  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_116_0.jpg)",
