    "document": "HUANG Binhong (1865-1955) \nGreen Silk Zither Garden (Liuji yuan) \n1931 \nHanging scroll, \nink on paper, \n93.2 x 31.2 cm \nGift of Mr Tang Cho-fung and Ms Leung Wai-yee \nHKLP.D.2011.1900 \nHuang Binhong was a noted landscape painter born into a family of scholars and painters. His work can be divided into two periods: the earlier 'White Binhong' era, characterised by delicate brushwork and a style reminiscent of Xin an School painting, and the later 'Black Binhong' era, which developed when Huang was in his eighties and began to paint intuitively with powerful brushstrokes in thick dark ink. His refined monochrome landscape demonstrates traces of his earlier White Binhong style. It depicts a complex of houses and gardens constructed in 1929 in Tai Po, Hong Kong, to house the liqitai, a famous zither from the Tang dynasty because the garden was destroyed by a typhoon in 1937, it is unclear if the painting depicts a realistic or idealised landscape. \nAn inscription states that it was painted between January and February 1931, at the request of Deng Erya (1884-1954), a master seal-carver from Dongguan, Guangdong province, who obtained the zither in 1934 and had the garden built after he moved to Hong Kong in 1932. \"The two met when Huang visited Hong Kong in July 1928, and Deng welcomed him on behalf of the Hong Kong branch of the Guangdong Chinese Painting Research Society, which he co-founded in 1926.\" The painting appears to celebrate the nobility and integrity associated with one of the zither's previous owners, the Ming loyalist Kuang Lu (1602-1648), as well as Deng's ownership of the instrument. After Huang completed it, Deng rewarded him with a seal carved with his name. \n1931 年 \nHKLP.D.2011.1900 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_37_0.jpg)",
