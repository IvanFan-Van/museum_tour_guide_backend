The focal point is the midday ground, where most ink has been used to shape houses and lush vegetation. The mountains in the background are painted in an archaising style. Their vertical formal leads the viewer’s eyes down to the moist ink brushwork in the foreground. Light blue and dry lines form the rapids and streams on the left. According to the inscription, Zhang submitted the work to his friend and fellow painter Tao Wan (1911-2004), who complimented its style. \n1963 年 \nHKUP.2015.2172 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_53_0.jpg)",
