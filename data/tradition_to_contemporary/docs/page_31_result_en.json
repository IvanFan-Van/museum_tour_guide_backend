Most of his works are figure paintings that focus on the depiction of real-life tragedy in the early days of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). Huang went to the front lines of Hunan to sketch, creating many works that show casualties on the battlefield. This image of Guanyin (the abdication of mercy and compassion) is painted with flowing and uninhibited brushwork. It depicts the figure with eyes cast downward, as if grief-stricken, projecting the artist's compassion. \nHuang studied Chinese painting at a private art school run by Gao Qifeng (1889-1933) in the 1920s, alongside Chao Shao-ani (1905-1995). Subsequently, he studied under Gao Jianfu (1879-1951). He later taught at the Foshan Art School, the Foshan Nanhai Teachers' College and the Guangzhou Municipal Art School. When Guangzhou fell to the Japanese in 1938, he moved to Hong Kong, founding the Winter Society (southern side) with He Qiyuan (1899-1970) and Ye Shaobing (1896-1968). He returned to Nanhai after the Japanese army occupied Hong Kong, and ultimately died in poverty. \nHKUP.1997.1268 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_31_0.jpg)",
