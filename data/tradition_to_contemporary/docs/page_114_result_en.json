    "document": "## TSUI Kar-yeung (b. 1942)  \nSilliness 1997 or earlier Horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 68.9 x 136.4 cm Gift of Dr Lam Kwok- pun HKLP1997.1191  \nSilliness reveals Tsui Kar- yeung's experiments with colour as a medium to shape landscapes. It depicts a still, tranquil mountain landscape at dusk after the snow has fallen. Finally, primarily tones of blue that characterise works made by Tsui before 1997. The mountain is outlined with thick, spontaneous ink in the middle ground, which brings out white patches along the slopes- perhaps reflected light or snow. Echoing the sense, one of the seals refers to the sun setting in a remote corner of the earth.  \nTsui Kar- yeung grew up surrounded by traditional Chinese culture. His father was a calligrapher and painter, and he was mentored by several skilled Chinese painters. He learned brush techniques and splashed ink from Tang Hong (1926- 2018, a student of the famous mid- and- flower painter Yu Fei'an), Song- style landscape paintings from Pang Chap- ming (1908- 2002) and sketching from nature from Chao Shao- an (1905- 1998). The use of colour in works like Silliness appears to be most informed by Tsui's studies with Tang Hong, particularly Tang's use of the splashed ink style of Chang Dai- chien (1899- 1983); time spent in Japan in 1958 also informed his sense of colour.  \n## 76  \n## POON Chun- wah (b. 1936)  \nMountain Harmony 1997 Horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 94.9 x 178 cm Gift of the artist HKLP2005.1586  \nThis panoramic overview of rugged, cloudy mountains is painted in washes of green and brown, with delicate, textured brushwork. Fluffy white clouds between the ridges appear to move, adding a sense of dynamism to the work. The spatial arrangement of mountainous forms and voids leads the eye into the remote distance, opening up the composition and underlining the grandeur of the tall mountains.  \nA well- known nature photographer and keen traveller, Poon Chun- wah's approach to landscape painting was informed by his travels and a period of study under Lui Shou- kwan (1919- 1975). He moved to Hong Kong in 1959 and continues to actively participate in local and international exhibitions.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_114_0.jpg)\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_114_1.jpg)",
