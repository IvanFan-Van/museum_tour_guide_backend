    "document": "PAU Siu- yau (BAO Shaoyou, 1892- 1985)  \nSketch Demonstration of Ponies Undated Two hanging scrolls, one horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, (a) 78.3 x 30.8 cm; (b) 61 x 45 cm; (c) 45.1 x 66.4 cm Gift of Mr Kenneth Fung HKU.P.2004.1582 a- c  \nThese sketches were made using the 'boneless' method, in which washes of colour are applied to the paper without a guiding outline. Painted with carefree, spontaneous brushstrokes, they were most likely produced as step- by- step demonstration pieces for Pau Siu- yau's students.  \nBorn in Yokohama, Japan, and a native of Xiangshan, Guangdong province, Pau settled in Hong Kong in 1928. As a student in the Kyoto Institute of Art and Design in Japan, he was contemporary with Chen Shuren (1884- 1948), Zheng, bongshang (1881- 1958) and other accomplished modern Chinese painters who later worked predominantly in China and Hong Kong. Pau taught in both Japan and China, which he considered to be his home. He founded the Lai Ching Art Institute in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, and became a pioneering figure in art education.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_30_0.jpg)",
