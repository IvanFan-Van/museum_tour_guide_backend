He was responsible for the painting of this work, and composed a poem describing the beauty of the Alps during the couple's three summer visits to Europe. It mentions the sound of the village bell echoing as the sun set over the mountains, and calls attention to wisps of smoke rising from chimneys in the foreground. Chen- ying contributed a calligraphic inscription.  \nLeung Chen- ying was born in Shunde, Guangdong province. She studied both Chinese and Western painting with Xu Beihong (1891- 1953), the noted painter of horses and birds, at Guilin Art Teachers College in Guangxi province in 1938. She was known for the beauty of her calligraphy, which she learned by copying ancient masterpieces and rubbings.  \n59  \nTSUU Kar- yeung (b. 1942)  \nLotus  \n1990  \nHorizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 66.5 x 37 cm  \nHKUP2006.1627  \nExecuted with elegant brushwork, this painting depicts a blossoming lotus among leaves. The pinkish lotus enlivens the monochrome ink leaves, which also convey the visual pleasure of colour and erudition. The painting was dedicated to Professor Cheng Yiu- chung (b. 1939), a former chancellor of the City Polytechnic of Hong Kong (now the City University of Hong Kong) and HKU. The inscriptions attest that Professor Cheung collected the work in 1990.  \nTsui has close ties to the City University of Hong Kong, which houses the Tsui Kar- yeung Collection of Art—including over one hundred works of calligraphy and paintings donated by Tsui. Many were displayed in various parts of the former City Polytechnic campus in the late 1980s while its Kowloon Tong campus was under construction.  \n1990 年  \nHKUP2006.1627  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_94_0.jpg)\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_94_1.jpg)",
