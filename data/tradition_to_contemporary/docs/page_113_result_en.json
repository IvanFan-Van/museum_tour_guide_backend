    "document": "## LEUNG Kut-ting (LIANG Juting, b. 1945) \nA Flower Is Not A Flower\n1996-2001\nHanging scroll,\nink and colour on paper,\n54 x 63 cm\nGift of the artist\nHKUP.2008.1714 \nThis modern ink painting eschews explicit geometric patterns (see cat. 41). Instead, a variety of forms show the painter's interest in utilising diverse brushstrokes and ink techniques to create an abstract composition. The rendering of lines underneath the splashed ink also suggests the artist's interest in printmaking techniques. As the title indicates, it is not a realistic depiction of a flower. The abstract image is symbolic or may simply represent a fleeting moment in life. Much of Leung's style was shaped by his teachers Lui Shou-kuan (1919-1975) and Wucius Wong (b. 1936), who he studied with at the Department of Extramural Studies, CUHK. \n## 74 \nYANG Jiechang (b. 1956) \nTriangle Cross \n1996 \nVertical scroll, \nink on paper, \n47 x 38.2 cm \nGift of the artist \nHKUP.1997.1395 \nTriangle Cross explores the materiality of ink as a medium on a relatively small scale. It features a single form: an abstract triangle cross, formed from numerous layers of black ink embedded in wrinkled sawn paper. The thickness of the ink gives the sculpture a reflective, metallic quality. Yang applied multiple layers of ink as if writing in a diary, each layer reflecting his moods and memories. \nYang Jiechang is celebrated for his series One Hundred Layers of Ink, which he painted between 1989-1999 using techniques similar to Triangle Cross. Some of these were influenced by Western art, while Yang encountered through lectures given by Joan Lebold Cohen (b.1932), an art historian, curator and photographer at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts. He has spent two years studying Taosim on Mount Luofu and Zen Buddhism at the Guangxiao Temple between 1984 and 1986, but his work was perhaps most influenced by a move to Paris in 1989, which provoked a significant change in his life and art. He began to deconstruct traditional Chinese paintings and calligraphy and to explore abstract forms using Chinese materials and tools as methods of self-reflection and cultivation. \nHKUP.2008.1714 \n1996 年 \nHKUP.1997.1395 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_113_0.jpg)",
