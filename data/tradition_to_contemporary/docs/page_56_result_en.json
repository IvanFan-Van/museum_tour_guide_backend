    "document": "LUI Shou- kwan (LÜ Shoukun, 1919- 1975)  \nLandscape  \n1964  \nVertical scroll, ink and colour on paper, 178.3 x 97.2 cm HKU.P.D.2002.1409  \nIn contrast to his views of Hong Kong sketched from life, this painting reveals Lui Shou- kwan's emphasis on the spiritual content of art. Rather than depicting a specific place, contrasting thick vertical and horizontal brushstrokes create the idea of landscape. Fragments of landscape imagery, such as landscapes of horizontal undulating hills and vertical rocks, are painted with patches of ink to convey the volume of mountains. Standing figures are scattered along remote paths, and a cluster of geometric shapes that resemble houses sits beneath the distant mountains, their position contributing to the rhythmic visual flow.  \nLui Shou- kwan's body of work can be divided into landscapes and his Zen series, both of which incorporate elements of abstraction. Landscape is a semi- abstract painting that demonstrates Lui's attempt to meld Western modernism—which he was exposed to through his participation in exhibitions in the United States, Britain and Europe—with his traditional brushwork. Like much of his painting from the mid- 1950s onward, its use of light, colour and atmosphere was also informed by the work of nineteenth- century British landscape painter J.M.W. Turner (1775- 1851).  \n1964年  \nHKU.P.D.2002.1409  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_56_0.jpg)",
