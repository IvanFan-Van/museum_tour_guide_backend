    "document": "WAN Qingli (1945-2017) \nMountains after the Snow \n1995 \nSet of four hanging scrolls, \nink on paper, \n186.5 x 96 cm each \nGift of the HKU Museum Society \nHKU.P.1997.1272 \n1995 年 \nHKU.P.1997.1272 \nThis majestic winter landscape reflects characteristics of typical Northern Song landscape paintings. A waterfall plunges hundreds of feet amidst blocks of mighty mountains protruding in the middle ground, with an impenetrable screen of monumental mountains in the background. Wintry trees in the foreground are depicted with short downward-drooping tree branches, evoking the 'crab-claw' style of the Five Dynasties and early Song painter Li Cheng (919-967). Tall trees set along the rivers appear in the classic level-distance formula, extending to the far right. \n\n",
