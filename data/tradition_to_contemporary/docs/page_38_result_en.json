    "document": "XU Beihong (1895-1953) \nSong of the Pipa (Pipa xing) \n1938 \nVertical scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n87 x 66 cm \nHKU.F2002.1424 \nA man sitting with his back to the viewer leans forward to offer his sympathy to a woman who is sorrowfully strumming a pipa. This recalls a scene from Pipa xing ('Song of the Pipa'), a poem by the famed Tang poet Bai Juyi (772-846), which centres on an entertainer singing of her faded beauty and unhappy marriage. The poem is set on a boat, but Xu Beihong transports the scene to a candle-lit stage to highlight the emotion of the entertainer. A poem inscribed on the left curtain by Ma Kuan (aka Ma Chien or Ma Jian, 1883-1959) poignantly compares Bai's poem to the misfortunes that Bai suffered in life. \nA celebrated painter of galloping horses and monumental paintings from Yixing, Jiangsu province, Xu began studying painting with his father Xu Dazhang at the age of six, learning by copying the works of ancient masters. He studied Western painting at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris while living in Europe between 1919 and 1927. He presented this work as a gift to the Chinese Society of HKU on the occasion of an exhibition of his collection of paintings and calligraphy held at the Fung Ping Shan Library in 1938. \n1938 年 \nHKU.P.2002.1424 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_38_0.jpg)",
