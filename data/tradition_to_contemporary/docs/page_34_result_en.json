    "document": "ZHANG Hong (1891-1968) \nPunch Tree Blossoming in the Fall \n1926 \nHanging scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n105 x 51 cm \nHKUP.1990.0928 \nThis painting presents a view of isolated cottage houses near a lake and hillside. Expressive calligraphic lines portray layers of trees and plants, with a hint of pink applied to a blossoming tree beside the main house. According to the inscription, it was painted in September, during a rare blossoming of peach trees at the home of Guo Fang in Shatin, Hong Kong. It was painted in response to a request made by Guo Fang, a famous recluse, who wanted to document the blossoming, which more commonly occurs in spring. The remote location and blossoming peach trees appear to be an allusion to the scholar-official Tao Yuanming (ca. 365-427), who was known for his reclusion in a small house in the countryside and for his celebrated essay Peach Blossom Spring. Zhang's admiration for Guo Fang is expressed in the inscription and complemented by colophon surrounding the painting by the scholar and seal carver Deng Fei (1884-1954) and other literati. Their words reveal deep respect and speak to a complex web of social obligations and networking in the literati community. \nZhang Hong was a painter, poet, connoisseur and antique dealer from Shunde, Guangdong province, who worked under the courtesy names Gu Chu and Shen Qi. He was a key member of the Guangdong Chinese Painting Research Society (Guangdong guohua yanjiuhui), which advocated for the preservation and growth of Chinese painting within a traditional framework. It started a two-year public debate with the Lingnan School in 1926 on how best to approach the modernisation of Chinese painting. Supporters of the Lingnan School promoted a new type of Chinese painting that synthesised Chinese and Western art and ancient and modern art. Although the two groups disagreed on the extent to which Eastern and Western techniques should be blended, both primarily sketched from life and incorporated contemporary scenes into their paintings. A seasoned traveller, Zhang spent time in many different locations, including Hong Kong. He often sketched outdoors in Huang Binhong's (1865-1951) shop and other painters. Despite its unpopular and remote nature, Shatin was the site of an important discussion between Huang, Zhang and others in 1935, which was documented in Huang Binhong on Painting (Binhong huayu lu). \n6 Huang 1997, pp. 185-193. \n7 Zhang 1936, pp. 11-13. \n1926 年 \nHKUP.1990.0928 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_34_0.jpg)",
