    "document": "LEUNG So-ying (LIANG Suying, b. 1930) \nLandscape \n1980s \nVertical scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n119.7 x 59.6 cm \nHKU RZ.201.407 \nLeung So-ying studied Chinese painting with several notable painters in the Department of Extramural Studies at CUHK in the 1960s. Perhaps the biggest influence on her style of landscape painting was Lui Shou-kwan's (1919-1975) brush and ink Painting (danshou) course. In this vertical work, the density of paint in the composition varies between the top and bottom. The top presents a horizontal view of continuous, undulating ridges and towering mountains, while the lower half is composed of mysterious abstract patterns. Executed in monochrome ink, the mountains extend from the middle ground to the far end, with the sky acting as a void. In the foreground, wave patterns in lighter ink tones seem to surge forward impossibly. \nLeung founded the One Art Group in 1970, along with several other students of Lui Shou-kwan. She participated in local and overseas exhibitions when the New Ink movement was in vogue in the 1970s, including New Directions in Chinese Painting: 11 Contemporary Chinese Artists at the University of Kansas Art Museum in the United States and several group exhibitions held at HKU in 1973 and 1974. \nHKU P.2002.1407 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_90_0.jpg)",
