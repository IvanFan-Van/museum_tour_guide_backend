While the composition evokes the sun above an undulating sea, it also creates the image of an inner universe, reflecting the artist's thoughts and emotions. \nIrene Chou was born in Shanghai but spent most of her life in Hong Kong before moving to Melbourne, Australia in 1991. The use of calligraphic lines in her work was informed by years of studying calligraphy and traditional Chinese ink painting techniques, especially the 'Storm Drum' script, which was first used to inscribe stones during the Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE). She was heavily influenced by her teacher and friend Lui Shou-kwan (1919-1975)—particularly his incorporation of styles and techniques from Western abstract art. \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_71_0.jpg)",
