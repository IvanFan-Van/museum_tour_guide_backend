Chao was influenced by Lingnan School painter Gao Qifeng (1889- 1933) and his elder brother Gao Jianli (1879- 1951), who was associated with the Geshan School.  \nIn his early works, he highlighted the essence of nature by sketching in the natural world, which is exemplified by the realistic landscapes. These bird- and- flower paintings showcase his signature style, developed in the middle of his career, which is characterised by bright colours and bold brushstrokes. Several include calligraphic inscriptions that echo Chao's approach to line drawing.  \nAn educator as well as a painter, Chao taught at several institutions in Guangdong province, including Guangzhou University, before moving to Hong Kong. He established the Lingnan Art Studio in Guangzhou in 1930, which moved with him to Hong Kong in 1948, where Chao would go on to nurture many local painters.  \nHKUP.1992.0972.1- 10  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_52_0.jpg)\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_52_1.jpg)",
