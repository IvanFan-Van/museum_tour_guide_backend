    "document": "CHENG XI (1919-1998) \nLandscape after Wu Zhen \n1952 \nVertical scroll, \nink on paper, \n68.3 x 34 cm \nHKUP.2015.2131 \nWu Zhen (1280-1354) was a reclusive Yuan painter who lived in self-imposed exile in the mountains of Zhejiang province, far from the Mongol court in Beijing. Celebrated for his landscape paintings with fishermen, he was considered one of the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty. This work was painted in Wu's wife's and depicts his favourite subject matter. It conveys Cheng's admiration for the natural world and literati ideals of seclusion espoused by Yuan painters such as Wu Zhen, Wang Meng (ca. 1308-1385) and others. \nBorn into an educated family in Wen'an, Hebei province, Cheng graduated with a degree in Chinese literature in 1948 after studying under Tshen Yin-koh (aka Chen Yinke or Chen Yinque, 1890-1969) at Yenching University in Beijing.1 He had broad interests that spanned drama, painting, poetry and Buddhist philosophy. He remained largely unknown during his lifetime, but his contribution to the field of Chinese drama has been revisited in recent years. After moving to Hong Kong in 1951, he worked at the School of Chinese Studies at HKU from 1951-1959. He gave this painting to F. S. Drake (1892-1974) after Drake was named a Professor of Chinese at HKU in the winter of 1952. \n1952 左 \nHKUP.2015.2131 \n14 Professor Tshen Yin-koh was an accomplished Chinese scholar and historian. He was invited to be the Chair of the School of Chinese Studies when Professor Hsu Tsi-huan passed away in August 1941, but he only held office for a short time. \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_43_0.jpg)",
