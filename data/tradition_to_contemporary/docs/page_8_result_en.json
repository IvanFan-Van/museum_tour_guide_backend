    "document": "in the north, centred around Beijing and Tianjin, as well as the jindai style (metal and stone, or the style of inscriptions on ancient bronzes and stone tablets) in Shanghai, along with the more commercially popular work of the Shanghai School, which was characterised by unrestrained, powerful lines of calligraphy and bright bold colours. In the south, works tended toward an amalgam of East and West with Japanese influences, such as the Lingnan School's bird-and-flower paintings.  \nArt from Hong Kong has been continuously influenced by Guangdong art circles and the Lingnan School of painting. Many Mainland artists who moved to Hong Kong retained their distinctive local and personal characteristics, including the traditional literary patterns, academic patterns, Westerninfluenced artists and innovators intent on developing their own styles of painting.  \nIn the second half of the twentieth century, the 'modern ink painting' movement, led by Liu Shao-kuan, established itself as one of Hong Kong's mainstream artists' styles, joining bird-and-flower paintings of the Lingnan School and traditional literal landscape paintings. Modern ink painting was popular in private studios, and was also found throughout the curricula of art colleges and universities. This innovative new form was for a brief time unrivalled, and presented a fruitful alternative to traditional ink painting.  \nTaken as a whole, ink paintings from this period represent more than a rejection of various levels of traditional literary painting or the absorption of Western painting styles, rather, they serve as a consideration of both the past and future, a moment of transition between old and new. More precisely, these works explore new and more direct ways of departing from traditional painting—whether in terms of colour, composition, material, style and technique, or the creative thought processes and goals underpinning the paintings themselves—and, as such, they are multifaceted and constitute an epoch-making breakthrough. Due to the civil war between the Communist Party and Kuomintang (1927- 1930), followed by the Cultural Revolution (1966- 1976), regional and political  \ndifferences resulted in paintings in the Mainland and Hong Kong displaying varying degrees of change during this period.  \nThis publication presents the development of 'mainstream' Hong Kong art from that time, with mainstream here referring to Cai Yuanpei's (1868- 1940) slogan of 'aesthetic education not religion', as academic painters held the reins in art circles in both the Mainland and Hong Kong. In order to more clearly analyse the development of the Hong Kong art world through the UMAC collection, four sections divided according to artistic style will provide a macroscopic view of the various styles in Hong Kong throughout the twentieth century.  \n## Imitation and Archaism  \nMany of the works presented here are traditional literary and landscape paintings. This includes those done in the style of the Song and Yuan periods. Four Masters of ink-and-flower painting, such as Lu Zhiyun's (1900- 1978) landscape in the Style of Li Liqing (cat. 18), which illustrates the composition of Ni Zanshi (1301- 1374) who revivals in a plain, sparse setting, or Ting Ying-ying's (1903- 1978) imitations of Bada Shanshan's vigorous, freehand ink-and-drawing painting (cat. 15); it also includes the more common contemporary form of landscape that 'uses the old to develop the new' and emphasises a naturalistic depiction rather than the use of 'ink stroke' rendering. This integration of a mode of simple folk art is seen in small album leaf works such as Tao Wan's (1911- 2004) Canei Pok, Guilin (cat. 61) completed when he was eighty, or Fang Zhaoliang's Flowers, Yigetaibai and Fruist (cat. 26), which imitates Qi Baishi's style.  \nOf the great artists of the twentieth century working in a traditional style, the most familiar here may be Huang Binhong and Tao Jiang's, along with the Hong Kong artists Ting Ying- yang, Fang Zhaoliang and Wan Qingli (1945- 2017). The work Green Silk Zither Garden (Lajin yaoxi) (cat. 16)—a rare example of the early White Binhong style of Huang Binhong, once the backbone of the Hong Kong National Picture School—was  \nLi Lian Huan, works from the 1930s and 1990s and painting landscape paintings in imitation of the ancient style, and show influences from Dong Qingbin and Shi Tao, among others. Winter Landscape is a traditional landscape sketch that is made in two to five landscapes while visiting Hong Kong. Not many of the early works traditional works were made in imitation of his earlier endeavors, he concentrated primarily on cultural and academic research and on disseminating his ideas. Accordingly, his paintings often include a long inscription, discussion or narrative. This work is rarely shown.  \n\n",
