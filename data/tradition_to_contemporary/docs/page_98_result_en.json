    "document": "Painted over a period of almost twenty years, these four landscape paintings have long inscriptions drawn from historical art texts. Deep in the Mountain quotes The Dust of Painting by Shen Hao (1586-1661), Floating Village features an extract from An Introduction to Painting by Gu Ningyuan, extract: ca. 1620- 1650) and Spring Blooms Covering the Mountain quotes teaching for Great Book to Sketch, an inscription by Shi Tao (1642- 1707). Tao Wan wrote his own inscription for Camed Peak, Guilin, which emphasises its expressive brushwork. Revealing Tao's thoughts on theories of aesthetic proposed by painters and scholars from the past, the inscription also echo his stylistic approach, which is traditional but accentuated with novel elements.  \nTao Wan was a traditional painter from Panyu, Guangdong province. He graduated from Sun Tai- sen University in Guangzhou and later studied under Pan Zhihong (1873- 1929), primarily by copying ancient masterpieces. He joined the Guangdong Chinese Painting Research Society in Guangzhou, before moving to Hong Kong in 1949 and then Toronto, Canada in 1989. His extensive travels within China and abroad informed his approach to landscape painting. In addition to his work as an artist, Tao was also an enthusiastic art educator. He taught at various institutions in Hong Kong from the 1950s to the late 80s, including HKU (1986- 1989) and CUHK (1981- 1986).  \n\n",
