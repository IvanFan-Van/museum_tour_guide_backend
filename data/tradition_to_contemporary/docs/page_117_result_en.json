It features bunches of plum blossoms—traditional symbols of spring, perseverance and the literal spirit. The flowers and branches interlock, highlighting the contrast between the bright red petals and ink branches. While the entire painting is executed with expressive brushwork, the brushstrokes on the right are particularly free and informal, lending the work a sense of abstraction and spatial depth.  \nJin Yanshi is a Yangzhou- based calligrapher and painter known for his paintings of plum blossoms. Yangzhou appears to have produced an unusually large number of painters specialising in plum blossoms, including Wang Shishen (1686- 1759), Jin Nong (1687- 1773) and Gao Xiang (1668- 1752).  \nHKU.2000.1362  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_117_0.jpg)",
