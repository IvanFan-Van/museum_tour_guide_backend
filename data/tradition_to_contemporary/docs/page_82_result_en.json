    "document": "## LIEW Come-tong (LIU Qindong, b. 1949) \nMountain Dwellings \n1983 \nHanging scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n166 x 96 cm \nGift of the artist \nHKUP2008.1721 \nMountain Dwellings references monumental landscape paintings from the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), as exemplified by Fan Kuans (ca. 950–1032) 'Travellers among Mountain and Streams', while incorporating modern approaches to ink painting. Instead of using schematic dots and finely textured strokes to form clusters of raindrops to model the mountains, Liew applied an ink wash to highlight the texture of the stone and moss ambience. Beneath the mountains, modern buildings are shown surrounded by tall trees and hills. Small but vividly painted in red, they hint at hidden pathways and people. Other motifs are treated in a more conventional manner, such as waterfalls and streams in the foreground. Together, these elements represent a traditional compositional device used in Song paintings to convey serenity and harmony in the universe. The painting is inscribed with the first four stanzas of Mountain Temple at Lake Yong, a poem by the early Tang poet Zhang Daoji (667–730). It relays a lyrical vision of Buddhist temples amidst empty mountains all valleys, perhaps an expression of the artist's religious and philosophical views on transcending materiality and seeking spiritual freedom. \nMuch of the inspiration for Liew Come-tong's work comes from his extensive travels in Asia, Europe and North America. Born in Malaysia, he moved to Hong Kong from Taiwan in 1972. He studied with noted painters, printmakers and art historians, such as Huang Junbi (1898–1991), Maytin Kan (1911–1998), Li Lincan (1913–1999) and Chuang Shen (1933–2000). This gave him a deep appreciation for both Eastern and Western art theory, reflected in his publication, On Chinese and Western Art Criticism. \"An art teacher and critic, he also taught painting at CUHK and HKU between 1975 and 1998. \n1983 年 \nHKUP.2008.1721 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_82_0.jpg)",
