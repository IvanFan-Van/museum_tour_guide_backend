    "document": "Raymond FUNG Wing- kee (b. 1952)  \nThe Unforgettable Moment  \n1992  \nSix vertical panels, ink and colour on paper, 112.5 x 33 cm each Gift of the artist HKLP.D005.1587  \nThis abstract painting in ink and colour presents a visual space where water meets sky. Layers of monochrome ink represent the sky, while various washes peppered with colour suggest the rhythmic textural effects of the ocean's surface. The sun appears on each panel in a different position, descending from the sky into the sea.  \nAn architect and ink painter, Fung studied Chinese painting with several notable artists of the Lingnan School, including Yang Shansen (1913- 2004) and He Bali (b. 1945). He found his artistic voice in the New ink painting movement of the 1960s, which emphasised innovation and individual style over traditional practice. The rendering of visual space in this work expresses Fung's signature style from the 1990s, informed by his keen architectural and design sense. But the abstraction sets his vision apart from both architectural plans and realistic landscapes, and its subtle use of colour reflects the aesthetics of ink painting.  \n1992年  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_101_0.jpg)",
