    "document": "## LIU Haisu (1896-1994) \nMan Jiang Hong (Mount Huang) \n1988 \nHorizontal scroll, \nsplashed ink and colour on paper, \n95 x 177 cm \nGift of the artist \nHKU.P.1997.1144 \n1988 年 \nHKU.P. 1997.1144 \nLiu Haisu painted this work on his last visit to Mount Huang at the age of ninety-two. Vivid splashes of ink and a heavy use of colour showcase the grand, imposing mountain range, surrounded by flowing clouds. The expressive use of colour reflects the influence of post-impressionism on Liu's work, particularly his early paintings. A Chinese poem inscribed on the top left corner, The River is Red (Man Jiang Hong, expresses Liu's affection for Mount Huang, perhaps a reflection of wishful thinking, it is affixed with one of his seals carved with the words: \"Immortal Haisu\" (Haisu huxiu). \nHaisu had close ties to Hong Kong. In 1977, he held the exhibition Haisu: Old Man Painting and Calligraphy at the City Hall Museum and Art Gallery, followed by two solo exhibitions in 1981 and 1988. The 1988 exhibition was held shortly after his tenth visit to Mount Huang. In 1991, Liu received an honorary Doctor of Letters from HKU in recognition of his achievements in painting and art education. He donated a number of works to the university at a ceremony held in January of the following year. The Liu Haisu Gallery of the university museum is named in his honour, acknowledging his patronage of the museum and his contributions to art in Hong Kong.\n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_86_0.jpg)",
