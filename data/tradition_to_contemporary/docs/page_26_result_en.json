    "document": "# LIANG Yuwei (ca. 1840-1913)  \nLiangwei Undated Set of two folding fans mounted as album leaves, ink and colour on silk, 22.5 x 48.5 cm each Gift of Julia and Luke Tao HKUP.2015.2192. a,b  \nThese two paintings are typical of Liang Yuwei's smaller works, which were often painted on white silk cut into the shape of a folding fan. Liang made a number of small fan paintings in his later years, perhaps because they were less physically demanding to produce than his larger works. Painted from a low viewing angle, the vast horizon lines on the fans create expansive and bright vistas. The mountains and stones in the landscape are tinged with a grass-green and pale ochre-brown, giving the scene a feeling of freshness and vitality.  \nLiang's use of colour and technique departed somewhat from the traditional application of textural strokes, perhaps reflecting the influence of Western painting, which was well established in China by the nineteenth century. An excellent seal carver, Liang probably carved several of the seals on the album leaves, including the collector's seal of Chen Kun (Stone Cliff).  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_26_0.jpg)",
