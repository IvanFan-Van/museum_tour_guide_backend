    "document": "# LEE Wai-on (LI Wei'an, b. 1937)  \nA Crowd of People 1980s Horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 133 x 178.4 cm HKU.P.2002.1406  \nUpon closer inspection, the compact brownish strokes of this painting are revealed to be thousands of people crowded together. Though their faces are indistinct, their postures and clothes are carefully outlined. The ink tones vary subtly from a light brown at the top to a much darker brown at the bottom. This suggests a decrease in density as the eye moves downward, with the top representing both the front of the crowd and the focal point of the painting. The figurative representations of the people reflect a modernist narrative mode. The artist silently joins the group by signing his Chinese name at the bottom right.  \nLee Wai-on moved to Hong Kong in 1950. His work was first exhibited at the In Tao Association's inaugural exhibition, The First Joint Exhibition of In Tao Art Association, in 1968. He is perhaps best known for a 3,400 sq. ft. mural painting of eighty- eight Taoist deities, which he painted above the front doors of the Furuma Hotel in Hong Kong in 1973. In 1966, he established a studio (Lee Studio) with his wife Ching man (also a painter) and became a full- time painting instructor, later teaching in the School of Architecture and the Department of Extrural Studies at HKU.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_93_0.jpg)",
