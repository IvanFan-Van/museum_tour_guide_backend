    "document": "FANG Zhaoling (FANG Chao- ling, 1914- 2006) \nGoldfish in the Style of Xu Gu \n1995 \nHanging scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n88 x 68 cm \nGift of the artist \nHKUP.1996.1219 \nThe three goldfish in the middle of the painting swim forward in the style of Xu Gu (1823-1896), an itinerant painter of the Qing dynasty known for his images of everyday life. His style is reflected in both the frontal position of the fish and their oval bodies, large, roundly empty cropping Xu Gu by dipping ink of different concentrations onto the paper to create the appearance of a greenshift pond, a technique which she began experimenting with in 1906. Fang's soft, expressive brushwork is used to great effect to juxtapose the shapes of different fish, which move in different directions to create a sense of rhythm in the composition. \nXu Gu was one of the best-known artists of the Shanghai School, which was comprised of a group of nineteenth-century professional painters who placed less emphasis on symbolism than earlier literary painters. He and Fang shared a penchant for personal simplicity and the sensual enjoyment of daily life, as well as a common hope for a peaceful world—expressed here in the way the fish move harmoniously in their environment. In her own words, the work is \"in the style of the paintings of Xu Gu, yet transforms them.\" \n1995 生 \nHKUP.1996.1219 \nWAN Qingli (1945-2017) \nAncient People \n1995 \nHanging scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n62 x 115.5 cm \nGift of the artist \nHKUP.2002.1452 \nNaked figures of men and women, including a breastfeeding mother and baby, form the centrepiece of this painting. They represent the inhabitants of a primitive village, living simple, self-sufficient lives. The controlled and dense brushwork is typical of paintings by Wang Meng (ca. 1308-1385), a celebrated painter from the late Yuan dynasty. Wan shared the associations and ideals of Yuan literature patrons and admired their composition and brushwork. The archaic simplicity of the scene is meant to evoke a dream-like vision of the life of a hermit—a common theme in Yuan painting. \nIn the inscription, Wan describes how the simplicity and sincerity of Wanqing fu, a calligraphic work by Wang Meng's grandfather Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322), moved him to paint an ancient subject. While he noted that his brushwork could not compete with that of Wang and his grandfather, Wan saw Ancient People as a necessary counterpoint to Western-style painting that flourished in China in the late twentieth century. \nWan graduated from the Department of Art History at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and he received his PhD from the University of Kansas. He taught in the Department of Fine Arts at HKU from 1999 until his retirement in 2006. \n1995 年 \nHKUP.2002.1452 \n\n",
