    "document": "Gifts of Twentieth- Century Chinese Painters and Their Relationships with the University of Hong Kong  \nMichelle Ying- Ling Huang (Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Visual Studies of Lingnan University)  \nFounded in 1953, the Fung Ping Shan Museum of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), renamed the University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) in 1994, was the first university- based teaching museum in Hong Kong. Over the decades, it has played a pioneering role in collecting Chinese antiquities, pictorial and applied arts from the Neolithic period (ca. 7000- 2100 BCE) to the twenty- first century, providing a range of artworks of historical importance and high aesthetic quality for the teaching and learning of Chinese art and museum studies. For more than six decades, the growth of the collection has largely benefited from the gifts of collectors, artists, scholars and donors. The modern paintings at UMAG have been assembled over the past four decades. The works demonstrate the stylistic development of Chinese painting from the late Qing dynasty (1644- 1911) to the end of the twentieth century, and embody human interactions, particularly the relationships between art teachers and their students, and between HKU and its donors.  \nThis catalogue includes several works by important twentieth- century Chinese painters who taught painting and calligraphy in private studios, schools, art colleges and universities in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing and Hong Kong, as well as other regions, and who exhibited widely in museums and galleries within and outside China. Perhaps the most notable is Liu Haisu (1896- 1994), who in November 1912 co- founded the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, the first art institution of modern China, in order to teach Western painting. It was there that human models were first used in art classes in China in 1915, with a curriculum that covered the theory and practice of both Chinese and Western art. Together with Liu Haisu, Li Yishi (1886- 1942) and Liu's student Pan Yuliang (1895- 1977) also taught Western painting at the academy. Both of them studied Western art—Li Yishi  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_14_0.jpg)",
