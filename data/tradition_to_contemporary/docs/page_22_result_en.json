Rather than applying wrinkle and skimming strokes in dry ink to model the structure and texture of rocks and mountains, as was done by most landscape painters, Su painted the scenes in four album leaves with sketchy outlines, reminiscent of illustrations in printed books.  \nA native of Shunde, Guangdong province, Su was originally named Changchun. His sobriquet was Jingfu, and when he changed his name to Renshan, he used Changchun as his courtesy name. Though a talented painter, he failed the imperial examinations multiple times. Fructuated by his failures and burdened by conflicts with his family, his behavior became increasingly eccentric, and by the end of his life he was thought to be insane. His unusual character was often expressed in the form of lengthy inscriptions, in which he engaged with topics ranging from astronomy and geography to history and mythology. Lengthy and varied, they were usually too abstruse to be fully understood.  \nHKLP.2015.2191 a-d  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_22_0.jpg)\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_22_1.jpg)",
