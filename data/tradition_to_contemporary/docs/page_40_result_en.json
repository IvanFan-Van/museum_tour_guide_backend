    "document": "LU Zishu (1900- 1978) \nLandscape in the Style of Li Liufang \n1940 \nHanging scroll, \nink on paper, \n91.7 x 33.5 cm \nGift of Ma Lu Yue \nHKUP.1997.1266 \nLu Zishu was a prominent member of the Guangzhou-based Cooperative Painting Society (later renamed the Chinese Painting Research Society), which promoted traditional approaches to painting, in opposition to the rising, modern School, which pioneered reforms in traditional Chinese painting in the early twentieth century. In keeping with the aims of the Society, Lu created this landscape in the style of late Ming painter Li Liufang (1575-1629). Li Liufang himself painted during a time of rising nostalgia for the past and drew particularly on the sparse compositions of Yuan dynasty painter Ni Zan (1306-1374). The use of a 'one river, two rivers' bamboo composition in this work, and depictions of trees and a thatched pavilion in the foreground, stems from Ni Zan's style, while the moist brushstrokes are more characteristic of Li Liufang's technique. \n1940 年 \nHKUP.1997.1266 \nTSENG Woon-wan (1915-1996) \nGibbon, Maple Tree and Full Moon \n1947 \nHanging scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n123.6 x 32.7 cm \nGift of the artist's daughter \nHKUP.1996.1195 \nThe scenery in this painting echoes the second line of a poem inscribed in the top left: \"The bright moon [shining in the sky] illuminates a maple tree and a howling gibbon. 'The branches and trunks of the tree that the gibbon rests on are outlined in calligraphy lines, with the leaves painted in the yellow and red of autumn. The large, full moon and the use of pale colours are reminiscent of Japanese paintings.\" \nThe grouping of these images represents a common device in Chinese art: the use of homophones to create visual puns. Together, the tree and the monkey represent the phrase 'conferring the rank of marquis' [fengwu], because the Chinese term for maple [feng] is a homophone for the verb 'to confer', while the term for monkey [hua] is a homophone for marquis. The first line of the poem, \"Shu dao qiu xing boyi\", states that the road to Shu (an ancient kingdom situated in modern-day Sichuan province) is rugged and difficult. The painting therefore depicts a gibbon howling in a maple tree during a full moon in the kingdom of Shu. \nOriginally from Panyu, Guangdong province, Tseng Woon-wan is a lesser-known female painter. She graduated from St Paul's Girl's College (now St Paul's Co-educational College in Hong Kong). She studied with Pau Siu-yau and frequently painted insects, fish, birds and flowers. \n1947 年 \nHKUP.1996.1195 \n\n",
