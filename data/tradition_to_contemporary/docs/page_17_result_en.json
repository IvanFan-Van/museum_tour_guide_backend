    "document": "The album Flowers, Vegetables and Fruits (1956- 1982) (cat., 26) includes works that Fang produced in Oxford, London and Hong Kong. Roses, a leaf from that album, shows her use of the Lingnan style while in Oxford. Other paintings in the album reveal that Fang modeled some of her work on the art of twentieth- century Chinese masters who she admired. Cuubs and Cuubs of Chrysanthemums are reminiscent of Qi Baishi (1864- 1957), who was famous for his vivid ink paintings of fishes, shrimps and crabs. Lotus, painted in 1982 and the last leaf in the album, highlights the splashed ink technique that Fang Zhaoling learned from Chang Dai- chien, who became her mentor in 1953. In the 1980s, both Chang Dai- chien and Fang Zhaoling painted lotuses in Chinese ink with this expressive technique. Works of this kind had a particular appeal to British curators and collectors, who may have been familiar with them from Zhang's and Fang's solo exhibitions at the Grosvenor Gallery, London in 1965 and 1968, and the Loan Exhibition of Modern Chinese Painting at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh in 1967. The influence of Qi Baishi and Chang Dai- chien on Fang Zhaoling's choice of motifs is also evident in another painting in the UMAG collection, Tomatoes (1972), and is referenced in the inscription. Fang travelled extensively in Japan, America, Europe and Asia for museum and gallery visits, exhibitions, sightseeing and family visits in the 1960s, but returned to China more frequently in the 1970s and subsequent decades. Apart from the beautiful scenery of her homeland, another reason for her return was the opportunity to mount solo exhibitions in museums and galleries in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing and Hefei. Fang also returned to her alma mater HKU, \n11 Nine of UMAG's painting recently formed part of the exhibition of Painting Her Way: The Ink Art of Fang Zhaoling (2017) at Asia Society Hong Kong Center. See Shen and Andrews 2017. \n12 Fang Zhaoling was inspired by collections of Chinese art in major museums in London, Boston and Washington in 1961. She realised that nature was \"an inexhaustible source of materials for landscape painting\" and was motivated to travel extensively. She also returned to her homeland on more than twenty occasions between 1964 and 1988. See Fang 1988. \nwhich held her first solo show at the Fung Ping Shan Library in 1955. This exhibition displayed a few works of calligraphy in the standard and clerical scripts, along with primarily bird- and- flower paintings in \"a distinctly Chao Shao- an- style\". Fang's works were exhibited again at the Fung Ping Shan Museum in 1978, while a catalogue entitled Portfolio: Thirty-eight Facsimiles of Fang Zhaoling Painting, comprising works painted from 1961 to 1982, with accompanying object descriptions by the artist, was published in 1985. \nMore than three decades later, Dr Michael Lau, curator of the Fung Ping Shan Museum and a classmate of Fang Zhaoling at HKU, mounted solo exhibitions by her in 1988 and 1992. At the same time, the newly formed HKU Museum Society selected an exhibition of her work, Chinese Painting by Fang Zhaoling, for its inaugural event. This special exhibition showcased sixty paintings and calligraphic works executed from 1966 to 1988, with eighty-eight works included in an associated catalogue. The presentation focused on figural work and landscapes, and in particular scenes from Fang Zhaoling's travels in China, Britain, Switzerland, France and America. Her works expressed a love for nature, her motherland and its people, her response to current events, her empathy for drifters and her wish for world peace. Fang also produced calligraphy, especially running script, with reference to Tang poetry and the teachings of Confucius and Laozi, which was likely inspired by her early study of the Chinese classics under the private tutoring of the Wuxi scholars, Tao Bofang and Yang Sizhen in 1927, and her education in Chinese history, philosophy and literature at HKU from 1954 to 1956. \n13 Ibid. \n14 In 1991, Fang Zhaoling and Michael Lau began discussing a donation of her paintings and calligraphy to HKU. To celebrate the 80th anniversary of her alma mater, Fang Zhaoling presented a collection of her works to HKU at a presentation ceremony held at the Fung Ping Shan Museum on December 4, 1992. Forty- one paintings and works of calligraphy from 1974 to 1992 were put on display at the museum, while a comprehensive collection of 152 paintings and works of calligraphy were printed in the catalogue.
