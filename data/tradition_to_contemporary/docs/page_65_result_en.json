    "document": "## FANG Zhaoling (FANG Chao-ling, 1914-2006)  \nLandoaper in Sylashed Ink ca. 1962- 1968 Horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 48.7 x 68.7 cm Gift of the artist HKU.P.1996.1247  \nFang Zhaoling began to experiment with abstract expressionism—the post- war art movement that emphasised subjective emotional expression and spontaneous creation—in the 1960s, though she produced comparatively few works in this style. They differ significantly from her earlier figurative works and represent a move away from the influence of her teacher Chao Shao- an (1905- 1996). Freeing herself from Chinese painting conventions, Fang created abstract compositions full of texture and space by splattering ink; the movement of horizontal and vertical lines of different shapes and thicknesses conveying emotion and hinting at the act of painting.  \nFang's engagement with abstract expressionism mirrored that of her teacher Chang Dai- chien (1899- 1983) and other artists such as Lui Shou- kwan (1919- 1975). Rather than breaking entirely with traditional Chinese painting approaches, she and Chang adopted splash- ink techniques that can be traced back to the Tang dynasty (618- 907).  \nThis painting is undated, but may have been made in 1962, the same year as another work in a similar style entitled Gaitie in the Air. Both were shown at Fang's solo exhibition at London's Grosvenor Gallery from January 30 to February 23, 1968.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_65_0.jpg)",
