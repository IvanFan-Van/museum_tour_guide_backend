    "document": "Harold WONG Chung-fong (b. 1943) \nIn Search of the Tao \n1993 \nHorizontal scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n68.5 x 136.5 cm \nHKU.P.2004.1535 \n1993 年 \nHKU.P.2004.1535 \nIn Search of the Tao demonstrates Harold Wong's signature expressive brushwork with overlapping layers of strokes in dry and wet ink. Wong's landscapes are informed by both his traditional training in Hong Kong under the painter, calligrapher and seal-carver Koo Tsin-yan (1896-1978) and by Western approaches to observational painting. He was exposed to the latter as a student in London in the 1960s, when he spent many holidays at the Norfolk studio of English landscape painter Edward Seago (1910-1974). The carefully planned composition of the work reflects his observations of landscape paintings by Seago and other Western artists, as well as real-life coastlines. \nOther elements in the painting speak to Wong's interest in literati pursuits, such as scholars sitting in contemplation and searching for paths. These traditional elements were informed by the paintings of the masters such as Dong Yuan (ca. 934-962), Hua Yan (1682-1756), Yun Shouping (1633-1690), Kuncan (ca. 1612-1674) and Bada Shamen (ca. 1626-1705), but also Wong's family background and profession. His father, Wong Poo-hsie, had a large collection of Chinese paintings and Wong ran a classical painting gallery from 1977-1990. \n\n",
