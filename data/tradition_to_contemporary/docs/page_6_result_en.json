    "document": "Foreword  \nFlorian Knolle Director, University Museum and Art Gallery, The University of Hong Kong  \nThe twentieth century witnessed tremendous artistic activity, including ink painting's continued development and occasional breaks with tradition. From the late Qing dynasty (1644- 1911), Lingnan School painters migrated from Guangdong province to Hong Kong, introducing both young emerging artists and collectors with their various styles. Infused with a mindset to innovate, local artists advanced the genre by creating 'new ink' and 'splash ink' styles that related to and sometimes challenged conventional practice. Subject matter, interpretation and application remained important, as did technique and the quality of the brush work that continues to distinguish the now iconic work of long-established and emerging masters.  \nCurated from artworks within the museum's permanent collection, Tradition to Contemporary: Ink Painting and Artistic Development in 20th-century Chinese painters works that trace the evolution of ink painting in Hong Kong, and includes many of the masters that have built the city's art scene and museum collections. This publication offers a broad overview of the provenance and aesthetic quality of individual works, and the cultural interactions among twentieth- century Chinese artists, curators, collectors and scholars in Hong Kong, mainland China and abroad. It makes reference to individuals and their networks, to teacher- student relationships and to the generosity of the numerous painters who have helped the museum's holdings to grow, and whose work constitutes the foundation of UMG's educational work today. Since initiating its publicly accessible collection in the 1980s, UMG has been closely connected to the development of these painters and their work, and has actively documented the evolution of their artistic talents and the Hong Kong art scene.  \nWe would like to thank our vital community of donors—both the artists and collectors—for their generosity and for being part of this fascinating journey. We also would like to express our gratitude to the HKU Museum Society for their generous support of this publication and the exhibition on which this catalogue is based.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_6_0.jpg)",
