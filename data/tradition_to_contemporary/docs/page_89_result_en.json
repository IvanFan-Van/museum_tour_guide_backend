    "document": "Irene CHOU (aka CHOU Lu Yun or ZHOU Liyun, 1924- 2011)  \nAbstract Composition 1980s Vertical scroll, ink and colour on paper, 138.8 x 69 cm HKUP1986.1414  \nTwo spheres sit side by side at the centre of this abstract composition, separated by an uneven vertical line. On the left side, dense ink and the artist's distinctive violent and short brushstrokes—what she called 'impact structural strokes'—form a vertical zone, with a white ball at the centre. Sparse red dots at the top of the dividing line terminate in Irene Chou's personal seal, a tiny character for yun ('cloud') in seal script.  \nSeemingly simple, the composition demonstrates Chou's mastery of a range of techniques associated with both the 'impact structural strokes' of her Impact series and techniques associated with her 'Dark Painting' style, which she developed in the late 1970s. She has carefully applied multiple layers of ink wash to both sides of the thin main paper, systematically creating a sense of structure and depth, while forming a dark, thick and concentrated ink layer with a luminous surface and soft tones. Instead of the heavy calligraphic lines that she frequently employed between 1971 and 1975 (see cat. 38, Chou has delicately rendered intertwining roots or twigs with thin, resilient lines that spring up to the right of the vertical line above the red ball. The ink gradually lightens as the eye travels down the painting.  \nChou painted the work during a period of depression after the death of her husband Liu Shou- kwan (1919- 1975) and her husband Yang Yanqi (1920- 1978) in the late 1970s. Her works from this period were informed by her exposure to abstract expressionism, Neo- Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_89_0.jpg)",
