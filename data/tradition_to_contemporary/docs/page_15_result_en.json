    "document": "in Scotland from 1907 to 1912, and Pan Yuling in France and Italy from 1921 to 1927. Painters invited to teach Chinese painting at the academy included Huang Binhong (1865- 1955), Chang Dai- chien (1899- 1983) and Pan Tianshou (1897- 1971). In November 1918, Liu Hualu launched Fine Arts, the first art journal in China, to cultivate an understanding of Chinese and Western art and aesthetics from a broader comparative perspective.1 \nBetween 1919 and 1935, Liu Hualu travelled to Japan and Europe to study collections of Chinese, Japanese and European art, as well as developments in art education. To transform the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts into a national university of the arts, he was advised by leading educational reformer Cai Yuanpei (1868- 1940) and ordered by the Ministry of Education to make a study visit to Europe from 1929 to 1931. Liu Haisu's reports from his trip were published in the Shanghai newspaper, Shenbao, which detailed his visits to museums and his participation in exhibitions and other cultural activities across Europe. Returning to Europe in the autumn of 1933 on a mission of cultural diplomacy, Liu Haisu organised a well-received exhibition of modern Chinese painting (guohua), which opened at the Prussian Academy of the Arts, Berlin in 1934. Visitors marvelled at the beauty, sublime nature and tranquillity of the modern Chinese paintings, as well as the creativity and techniques of the painters who brought the indigenous tradition to new modern life.2 The exhibition was well-attended and was widely discussed by the media in China and the West. Liu was invited to tour the show in over ten European cities, including Hamburg, Düsseldorf, The Hague, Amsterdam, Geneva, Prague, Paris and London, over a period of about fifteen months. He also delivered lectures on the tradition and recent developments of Chinese painting.3 During the post-war years, Liu Haisu continued to perform his \nroles as a leading art educator and painter in China, although his work was interrupted by personal health problems and the Cultural Revolution (1966- 1976). In 1979, he began to regain recognition in China through a series of solo exhibitions, and was appointed to important official positions, such as the Director of Nanjing University of the Arts. New plans for building art museums dedicated to Liu Haisu were developed in the early 1990s, two of which opened in Changzhou and Shanghai in 1993 and 1995, respectively.8 \nIn March 1991, Haisu received an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from HKU in recognition of his achievements in Chinese painting and art education. The ninety-five-year-old painter visited the Department of Fine Arts and was welcomed by faculty member Wan Qingli (1945- 2017), who donated his paintings (cats. 68, 69) to UMAG in 1997 and 2002. Wan Qingli's landscape paintings share a distinct style with Liu Haisu's Winter Landscape (cat. 140, both paying homage to the literary tradition. Liu's later works, Mount Huang at Dawn and Man Jiang Hong (Mount Huang) (cats. 45, 51), diverge slightly from this style, demonstrating a freer use of bold colours and linear perspective for depicting expansive mountains and impressionistic landscapes. \nThese paintings were part of the gifts presented by Liu Haisu to HKU at the presentation ceremony titled Paintings for the Liu Hsi Su Gallery of Modern Chinese Art on January 21, 1992.9 This reflects a trend in the early 1990s, when HKU attracted donations and sponsorships from parties both at home and abroad, after announcing its plan to build a new gallery near the site of the Fung Ping Shan Museum.10 The establishment of the new gallery aimed to promote art education, art historical research and the artistic achievements of Liu Haisu, who regarded culture as \"an indispensable spiritual food for Hong \n1 For the reform of art education in China during the 1910s and 1920s, see Hearn 2001, pp. 20- 23 and Lim 1996, pp. 40- 47.

T. Tsui Building in 1996. See Tzi Kong Fao 1991. \n\n",
