    "document": "LU Huisu (1896-1994) \nWinter Landscape \n1926 \nHanging scroll, \nink on paper, \n131 x 66 cm \nGift of the artist \nHKU.P.1997.1143 \nThis monochrome ink painting depicts the 'Day of Great Cold' (Da Han) on January 21, 1926. According to the inscription, Liu Huisu struggled to make a fire in his home under heavy snow and was forced to paint with stiff, frozen arms, which may have contributed to the awkward brushwork. The base of the painting includes a poem inscribed by Huang Yanpei (1878-1965, courtesy name Ren Zhi), a friend of Liu's who was the Jiangsu Provincial Secretary of Education in the Republican period (1912-1949), charged with conducting education reform. A complete version of this poem, with slight changes, was published in The Diary of Huang Yanpei. \nInspired by Euro-American commercial art and post-impressionism, Liu focused on oil paintings early in his career. This represents one of his first attempts at experimental ink painting. The awkward and bold calligraphic lines reveal the influence of noted Epigraphic School painter Wu Changshi (1844-1927), calligrapher and art theorist Kang Youwei (1838-1927) and individualist painter Shi Tao (1642-1707). \n1926 年 \nHKU.P.1997.1143 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_35_0.jpg)",
