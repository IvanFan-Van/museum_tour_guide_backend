    "document": "In terms of landscape painting, Li Xiongeai and his successors Chow Chian-chiu and Chow Leung Chen-ying created vigorous, robust works that are carefully composed, although Li's technique proves to be more mature than Chow's. In terms of animal portraiture, Chiu sai-kwong's Enraged Lion imitates a Gao Qifeng (1889- 1933) painting from the fall of 1927. Gao made the painting at the invitation of a pupil as a contribution to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and it shows the revolutionary spirit of the new age. Chiu sai-kwong's teacher was Chao Shao-an, and Chao Shao-an's teacher was Gao Qifeng, so it is not difficult to discern the younger Chao's relationship to Gao. Chao's work was painted in 1958, just as he was holding his first solo art exhibition. According to his son, Zhao Lingbin, the exhibition offered a summation of his father's education up to that point, so many of the paintings were imitations of other painters' works. It is highly likely that this painting was among those shown at that exhibition. \n## Modern Ink Painting in Hong Kong \nLui Shou-kwan has been called the inventor of modern ink painting in Hong Kong, and among his students and other artists who have been influenced by his style are Irene Chou (1924- 2011), Laurence Tam Chi-sing (1933- 2013), Leung Kui-ting, Chui Tze-hung (b. 1936), Lee Wai-on (b. 1937) and Raymond Fung Wing-ke (b. 1952). \nThe most significant difference between modern ink painting and other Chinese ink forms (including contemporary ink painting) relates to whether the brushstrokes conform to traditional standards, shapes, composition and spirit. Some twentieth-century modern ink painters were influenced by American abstract impressionism, but Lui Shou-kwan's pioneering experiments retained a considerable degree of the Chinese cultural context and traditional value system. For \nexample, his Landscape and Zen (cats. 30, 33) take freehand brushwork and Zen iconography as their primary subject matter. In addition to examples of Lui's modern ink painting style, the collection also includes his early traditional ink paintings of Hong Kong scenes. These are rarely shown, and demonstrate his solid foundation in traditional Chinese painting techniques. \nDiverse methods evolved in the hands of different artists with their own particular interests and understanding of new ink painting. For example, Irene Chou's Concentration and Abstract Composition (cats. 38, 54), perhaps under the influence of her teacher Lui Shou-kwan, display a meditative philosophical flavour. In the former work, undulating crisscrossing lines create a distinct universe; in the latter, she uses a unique method of ink dots and form of abstract impressionism to express a sense of yin and yang, or perhaps Zen. Even today, her distinctive works invite extended contemplation. \nAnother artist well worth mentioning is Laurence Tam Chi-sing. Tam is best known as a former chief curator of the Hong Kong Museum of Art, but he was also an artist and tastemaker. Using an educational approach centred on Western painting, he promoted the teaching of new ink wash painting and made significant contributions to the development of new and modern ink wash painting in Hong Kong, as well as to the teaching of traditional Chinese ink painting techniques. His works are not often shown, but this exhibition features his Landscape (cat. 34), which was painted in 1970, during the early stages of the new ink painting movement in Hong Kong. In it, one can detect Tam's own personal understanding and practise of new ink painting.\n\n",
