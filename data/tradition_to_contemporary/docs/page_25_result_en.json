    "document": "LIANG Yuwei (ca. 1840- 1913)  \nFlowers of the Four Seasons Undated Set of four hanging scrolls, ink and colour on paper, 177 x 48 cm each Gift of Ma Lo Yue HKUP.1996.1196  \nMost of Liang Yuwei's extant paintings are landscapes, with a few works of flowering plants. These four flower paintings are among the largest he produced, suitable for hanging in a grand hallway. Reflecting Liang's interest in rubbing and ancient coin, they exhibit an epigraphic sensibility, with vigorous strokes and thick lines reminiscent of rubbing taken from inscriptions on bronze vessels and stele. Painted with Liang's characteristic jagged, woodcut outlines, each scroll features a flower associated with a particular auspicious meaning: plum blossoms, the renewal of spring; peonies, wealth and honour; and pine trees, longevity. Orchids and branches of somnathin (fragrant olives are commonly associated with well- wishes for sons and grandsons.  \nLiang used the courtesy names Hangshu and Hangue. A highly educated scholar- painter who served in the Ancestral Sacrifice and Purification Office at the Ministry of Rites in Beijing, in his later years he moved to Guangdong, where he made a living selling blue paintings. The collector's seal 'Prized by Stone Cliff', indicates that the scrolls were acquired by Chen Kun of Shunde, whose pseudonym was Stone Cliff. Chen was a successful businessman, and offered financial support to Liang, the artist's later years, but Liang was unwilling to accept charity. Chen found a way around this by having his friends purchase Liang's paintings on his behalf. The works always went to his personal collection.2  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_25_0.jpg)",
