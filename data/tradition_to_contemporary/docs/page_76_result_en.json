    "document": "CHAN Flora Kay (b. 1930) \nSwer Message III \n1981 \nVertical scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n63 x 58.7 cm \nGift of H. Chung King-fai \nHKU.P.2009.1854 \n1981 年 \nHKU.P.2009.1854 \nThe floral pattern in this painting is shown in close-up view, as if seen through a magnifying lens. The feathery petals unfurl into a pattern of line and shade, while the core is shrouded in darkness, crooking a sense of something hidden being slowly revealed. The interplay of light and dark, line and plane, creates an astonishing pattern that blends new idioms and styles inspired by Western painting. The artist's seal is partially hidden in an area of darkness on the bottom left. \nFlora Kay Chan was heavily influenced by the work of Lui Shou-kwan (1919-1975) and is perhaps best known for her contributions to scholarship on his art, which continue to serve as a primary source on his artistic development from the early 1950s to the 1970s.¹ She joined the One Art Group founded by his former students in 1968. \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_76_0.jpg)",
