    "document": "YUNG Shau-shek (RONG Shushi, 1907- 1996)  Birds and Flowers  1972  Album leaf,  ink and colour on paper,  33 x 31 cm  Gift of Professor Chee-woo and Grace Po-chan CHOW  HKU.P.2009.1842 \nThis painting celebrates the wedding of Chow Chee-woo and Grace Po-chan Chow, the son and daughter-in-law of Lingnan School painters Chow Chian-chiu (1910-2006) and Chow Leung Chen-ying (1921-2005). The focus of the work is a pair of blue maquies, which look upwards at a branch with their beaks open. \nBoth the flowers and birds are painted in the 'boneless' technique, using ink and colour washes applied directly to the paper without outlines. Blue maquies with long tails are sometimes called 'birds with longevity ribbons' or 'ribbon-tailed birds' (shoudaniao) and together with red flowers are traditional symbols of marriage in Chinese art, because the Chinese character for maquie is the same as the character for happiness. Maquies are often depicted together with plum blossoms, but Yung has tactfully paired them with pionnettia, a flower commonly displayed during Christmas, to reflect the December date of the wedding. \nYung studied painting under Gao Qifeng (1889-1933), an influential member of the first generation of Lingnan School painters, in Guangzhou. He was a founding member of the Yuan Art Club in 1948, which counted Chow Chian-chiu and Leung Chen-ying among its members. All three were also part of the Ping Sheng Art Club (founded in 1936), and participated in its fourth annual Chinese painting exhibition in 1960. \nLIN Jen-tong (LIN Jiantong, 1911-1994)  Lotus Seed and Lily Bulb  1972  Album leaf,  ink and colour on paper,  34.5 x 45.5 cm  Professor Chee-woo and Grace Po-shan CHOW  HKU.P.2009.1845 \nIn China, lotus seeds and lily bulbs are auspicious symbols that express wishes for a long and happy marriage. This painting was presented to Chow Chee-woo in celebration of his wedding. Lin Jen-tong was well-known for his paintings of flowers and plants, particularly plum blossoms, and went by the sobriquet Meichi (meaning 'someone obsessed with plum blossoms'). \n\n",
