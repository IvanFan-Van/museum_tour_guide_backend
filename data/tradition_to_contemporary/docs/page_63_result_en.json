    "document": "JÃO Tsung-i (RAO Zongyi, 1917-2018) \nA Pare and Remote View of Streams and Mountains\nafter Xia Gui \n1967 \nHandscroll, \nink on paper, \n28.4 x 142.1 cm \nGift of Professor Lo Hong-lit \nHKUP.2008.1643 \nThis work is a modern rendition of a Southern Song\npainting by Xia Gui (1195-1230) of the Imperial Painting\nAcademy. It depicts the scenery of Jiangnan, executed\nin Xia Gui's simple but strong slanted brushstrokes—\nsometimes called 'axe-cut strokes' (fupi cun) because they\nresemble chopped wood. Collected by the Qing court, it\nwas later moved to Taiwan along with other antiquities\nfrom the forbidden City during the Second Chinese\nCivil War (1946-1950). Jao Tsung-i was able to view it at\nBeigou, Taichung while the National Palace Museum was\nunder construction in 1950 and 1965. \nA polymath from Chao'an, Guangdong province, Jao\nwas well-versed in archaeology, art history and literature.\nHe had copied Xia's work more than once, and was\nfamiliar with its style, completing this version in one\nnight. It is not completely identical to the original, with\nsignificant alterations in the positions and proportions of\nvarious objects, and with slightly different brushwork.\nAfter leaving China in 1949, Jao taught at universities in\nHong Kong, Singapore, the United States and Taiwan,\nbefore retiring in 1978. He spent the remainder of his life\ntravelling and giving lectures. \n1967 年 \nHKUP.2008.1643 \n\n",
