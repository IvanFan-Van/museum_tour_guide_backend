    "document": "FANG Zhaoling (FANG Chao-ling, 1914-2006) \nFive Horses \n1990 \nHanging scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n139 x 69.5 cm \nGift of the artist \nHKUP.1996.1210 \nHorses have played a significant role in both military and civilian life in China for thousands of years. In Chinese paintings, they often represent the spirit of the literal Fang Zhaoling made this painting in 1996—the Year of the Horse in the Chinese lunar calendar. The horse closest to the base of the painting is a war horse, surrounded by a backdrop of loosely-painted horseshoes in black ink. Standing with its front leg lifted as if stepping forward, it has the rider build and the stirrup, upright tail of horse painted during the Tang dynasty. Two of the horses are saddled and bridled, with a child and a woman riding them. While the child's riding posture is stiff and its horse short-hilled and ungainly, the female rider and horse appear as one, galloping at full speed—probably a reference to contemporary racehorses. Together they highlight Fang's knowledge of the different types of horses used in historical Chinese paintings. \nIn her inscriptions, Fang often describes thoughts and insights derived from her everyday life and ink practice. In the large inscription at the top of this scroll, she discusses the experience of searching her mind for the different renderings of horses in paintings across the ages. The inscription and seals also mention Fang's physical frailty and her wish for longevity. \n1990 年 \nHKUP.1996.1210 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_95_0.jpg)",
