NG (Research Assistant Professor, Academy of Visual Arts, Hong Kong Baptist University)  \nIn addition to art from the Ming and Qing dynasties, twentieth- century ink painting constitutes the largest and most significant collection of painting held by the University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) of The University of Hong Kong (HKU). The vast majority of these works were created in Guangdong and Hong Kong, and are closely linked to their local art scenes. Included are works by renowned twentieth- century artists such as Xu Beihong (1895- 1953), Huang Binhong (1895- 1955) and Liu Hsiu- huan (1896- 1994), as well as locally recognized artists such as Chan Shao- san (1903- 1998), Fang Zhaoling (1914- 2006), Lui Shou- kwan (1919- 1975) and Jao Tsung- (1917- 2018), among others.

Change has proceeded slowly, and even one hundred years later we still see the repercussions of the past century's developments.  \nWhat is often referred to as 'Chinese painting', or ink wash painting, has always preserved its ways that reflect its own culture and artistic vocabulary, whether in terms of style or content. Chinese paintings from the late Qing dynasty (1644- 1911) and early Republican period (1912- 1949) were highly varied and in no way inferior to what was being produced in the West. There was the relatively traditional literati painting  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_7_0.jpg)",
