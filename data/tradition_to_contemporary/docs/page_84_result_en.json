    "document": "LAI Shaoqi (1915-2000) Mount Huang 1983 Horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 70 x 145.9 cm Gift of the artist HKLP.1984.0869 \nThe most famous pines in China grow on Mount Huang. Here, they are shown standing on cliffsides in a narrow gap between two mountain ridges. The compact shape of the mountain complements the calligraphic inscription in the top left corner. The characters are rendered in an awkward, block-character style that borrows elements from the clerical script-based 'lacquer script calligraphy' (qishu of Jin Nong (1687-1773)—one of a group of eighteenth-century painters active as the Eighteenth Century of Yangzhou), who rejected orthodoxy in favour of a more expressive and individualistic style. The content of the inscription includes the word Tianda, suggesting that the work depicts Mount Huang's Tianda Jing ('Heavenly Citadel Peak'). \nA long-time resident of Anhui province, Lai Shaoqi visited Mount Huang many times over the course of nearly three decades, and the area became the focus of his painting and writing. In his depictions of the mountains, he operated within an established framework of artists who included Shi Tao (1642-1707), Mei Qing (1623-1697) and Huang Binhong (1865-1955). He visited the range seven times between 1980 and 1982 while preparing to paint this work. A graduate of Guangming Provincial Art College and a member of the Modern Woodcut Society, Lai was perhaps best known as a printmaker and painter. Most of his works are currently housed in the Lai Shaoqi Museum of Art in Hefei, the capital of Anhui. \nFANG Zhaoling (FANG Chao-ling, 1914-2006) Dragon Boat Race (Ode to Peace, No. 6) 1985 Hanging scroll, ink and colour on paper, 67.8 x 99.8 cm Gift of the artist HKLP.1996.1205 \nFang Zhaoling returns to one of her favourite compositions in this painting, in which a red sun rises over Victoria Harbour. Dragon boats on the water race in a lively and energetic spectacle. Each carries a steersman at the back and a drummer at the front, with a team of paddlers in the middle propelling their long, narrow boats toward the finish line. Spectators from all walks of life fill several boats anchored near the pier. The late afternoon sky is dominated by orange-red tones, adding warmth and colour to the event. \nThe composition resembles Fang's 1984 painting Pacifull Settlement of the Future of Hong Kong. After China and Britain negotiated the future of Hong Kong and signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, Fang made several Ode to Peace paintings to express her positive outlook on the smooth transition and the future of the territory. Several of the paintings in this series feature dragon boat contests—normally held during the Year's Festival (also called the Dragon Boat Festival) on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. They express Fang's sincere wish for world peace. On this work she has playfully inscribed the flags of the boats with the characters for 'peace', 'long live world peace' and 'smooth sailing'. \n\n",
