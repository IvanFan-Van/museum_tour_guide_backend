    "document": "This album of ten leaves consists of flowers, vegetables and fruits painted by Fang Zhaoling over several decades. The earliest leaf was made in Oxford in 1956 and the final inscription was added in 1965. Born in 1914 in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, Fang Zhaoling settled in Hong Kong in 1949. She studied in both the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, receiving a bachelor's degree in Chinese philosophy and literature from HKI before furthering her studies in Oxford. Her early works reflect the influence of her teachers, Chinese painting masters Qian Songyan (1899- 1985) and Chao Shao-an (1905- 1998). Chang Dai- chien (1899- 1985) also played a significant role in her artistic development. Fang became a student of Chang in 1953, and followed in his footsteps on trips across Asia, Europe and North America. She developed a distinctly personal style of painting and calligraphy in the 1980s and soon after achieved international recognition as a contemporary artist.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_49_0.jpg)",
