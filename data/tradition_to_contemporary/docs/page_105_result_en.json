    "document": "LAU Wai-ming (1965-1998) \nFeeling \n1994 \nVertical scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n44.9 x 33.5 cm \nGift of M. Wong Oi Lan \nHKLP.2002.1441 \nThe pictorial space in this vertical scroll is organised with thick, loose and expressive brushstrokes in ink and bright colours. The forms dissolve into brushwork and colours, but three-dimensionality is conveyed by layers of rocks, streams, trees and rapids. Outlined in white with short, dry brushstrokes, the rapids give the work a sense of movement and light. This sense of movement and the tension between various elements convey the artist's spiritual and emotional state. \nLau Wai-ming suffered from cerebral palsy, which altered the way in which he wrote and drew. His passion for painting motivated him to learn to paint using a specially-designed head pointer, and his works are often called 'Head-painting'. Before he passed away in June 1998, Lau also experimented with many painting. He was recognised several times as an outstanding disabled artist, receiving a Fellowship for Artistic Development from the Hong Kong Arts Development Council in 1997. \n1994 年 \nHKLP.2002.1441 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_105_0.jpg)",
