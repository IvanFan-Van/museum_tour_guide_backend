    "document": "# HE Chong (1808-1884) and LUO Anxian (active late 19th century)  \nFeeding the Flodgings Undated Album leaf, ink and colour on paper, 35.6 x 59.7 cm Gift of John and Luke Tao HKLP.2015.2194  \nIn this collaborative work, He Chong painted the birds, and Luo Anxian was responsible for painting the background and writing the inscription. One of the birds is in the process of feeding three flodgings—a common scene in the natural world. Luo Anxian's inscription connects this to the Confucian ideal of filial piety and the love between parents and their children.  \nHe Chong used the courtesy name Danshan and the sobriquet Yanqiao. Born into a poor family in Nanhai, Guangdong province, he left for Guangzhou at age twelve, where he apprenticed at a lantern shop and later became a painter of tea chests. He caught the attention of wealthy businessman Wu Chongyao (1810- 1863), who hired him to assist in organising the family's collection of painting and calligraphy. The experience was critical to his artistic development. In 1842, He met general Yi Xiang (1796- 1881) and joined him on manoeuvres in Chengdu and Zhejiang province. After returning to Guangdong he sold paintings and taught for a living. He and Luo were good friends and collaborated on several works.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_28_0.jpg)",
