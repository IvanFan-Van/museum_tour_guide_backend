    "document": "LU Haisu (1896- 1994)  \nMount Huang at Dawn 1982 Horizontal scroll, splashed ink and colour on paper, 144 x 368 cm Gift of the artist HKU.P.1997.1133  \nAlthough many Chinese artists have painted Mount Huang in southern Anhui province, Liu Haisu's views are particularly celebrated. He visited the mountain several times in his lifetime. An inscription on this work reveals that it was made in the Beihai Hotel, when Liu climbed the mountain for the ninth time at the age of eighty- seven. One of his larger works, it demonstrates Liu's unique blending of Western and Chinese techniques. Largely self- taught, he was exposed to the former during a three- month painting course in 1909 at the Institute of Stage Scenery in Shanghai, and during several visits to Japan in the late 1910s. His synthesis of the two, together with an emphasis on the observation of nature, set him apart from his contemporaries, who typically painted by imitating earlier works.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_80_0.jpg)",
