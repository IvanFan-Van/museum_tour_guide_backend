    "document": "landscapes, Lui took a realistic approach to delineating mountains and houses and rendered the scene of Hong Kong Landscape primarily with fluid lines and ink dots. In the same year, he also began experimenting with a more expressive style by applying broad brushstrokes and bold ink washes to suggest layers of mountains in another Landscape (cat. 30). Lui's art became increasingly abstract as he shifted to a philosophical approach in his Zen series (cat. 33) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Lui Shou- kwan's landscape paintings generally emphasize the contrast of Chinese ink and empty space and evoke a sense of tranquility and meditation—in contrast with the landscapes of Fang Zhaoling, which are primarily filled with rhythmic brushstrokes, expressive colour and explanatory inscriptions.  \nLui Shou- kwan's aesthetic ideas, painting techniques and creative spirit were passed on to students such as Irene Chou (1924- 2011), Laurence Tam Chi- sing (1931- 2013), Chui Tze- hung (b. 1936) and Leung Kui- ting (b. 1945), whose works are highly individualised in feeling, abstract in concept and experimental in technique.  \nViewed as a whole, Tradition to Contemporary: Ink Painting and Artistic Development in 20th- century China provides readers with a further exploration of the provenance and aesthetic quality of myriad works; the cultural interactions among twentieth- century Chinese artists, curators, collectors and scholars in Hong Kong, mainland China and abroad; and the untold stories of significant gifts presented to HKU over the past several decades.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_19_0.jpg)",
