    "document": "# Laurence TAM Chi-sing (1933-2013)  \nLandscape 1970 Horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 79.4 x 108.3 cm HKU.P.2002.1411  \nLaurence Tam Chi- sing moved from Guangzhou to Hong Kong with his family in 1947. His approach to painting was informed by his teacher Lui Shou- kwan (1919- 1975), who promoted new ink methods that incorporated Western art elements. This work is one of few ink paintings that Tam produced between 1968 and 1970. It depicts a semi- abstract landscape of undulating mountains with volcanic craters, with contrasting areas of solid and void, light and dark. The mountains are outlined with ink and covered with washes to modify their tonality and give volume to the landforms. The space above is likely the sky, but abstract dots, circles and irregular patterns in light- brown ink convey a sense of mystery.  \nAlongside his work as a modern ink painter, Tam was an educator and curator who actively promoted education in ink painting and Hong Kong art. He was the founding president of the In Tao Art Association, which was formed by Lui Shou- kwan's students and became influential in promoting the New Ink movement. He also played a pivotal role in teaching new ink painting to secondary students at Wah Yan College Kowloon between 1968 and 1971. He began working as an assistant curator of Chinese art at the former City Hall Museum and Art Gallery Resource to the Hong Kong Museum of Art in 1971, becoming the first chief curator of the Hong Kong Museum of Art in 1985.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_67_0.jpg)",
