They are also often grouped together with plum blossoms and chrysanthemums and referred to as the 'Four Gentlemen', because they reflect the Confucian virtues of purity, modesty, loyalty and dignity. That they could be rendered monochromatically with ink and calligraphic brushwork made them particularly favoured subjects for literati artists.  \nThis collaborative painting was done in 1975 when Tao visited George Yeh, a Taiwanese diplomat and politician, in Taiwan. Tao used dry calligraphic lines to form the rocks as a base for the plants, with ink dots applied to indicate moss. Yeh added the bamboo and orchid. The ninety- five- year- old poet and calligrapher Li Gong Lin (1988- 1979) added an inscription to the painting in 1976, which reaffirms its symbolic nature. \"The orchid is the king of scents, and the bamboo is the moral integrity of a gentleman\".  \n40  \nTING Yin- yung (DING Yanyong, 1902- 1978)  \nLandscape  \n1976  \nHanging scroll,  \nink and colour on paper,  \n96.7 x 42 cm  \nGift of Mr and Mrs Shiu Lam Fung  \nHKUP.1993.0983  \nTing Yin- yung stylistically explores and transforms modes established by the Yuan dynasty painter Ni Zan (1301- 1374) in this landscape. Ni's signature 'one river, two riverbanks' landscapes were executed with monochrome ink in a cool, tranquil manner, which Ting immediately distorts through his use of colour. Despite his simple, naive strokes and the beauty of the scene, the inscription at the top left expresses a sense of desolation: \"the river is deep, and it is cold in the waterside pavilion in May\".  \nTing was proficient in both Western oil painting and Chinese ink painting, but in later life focused more on the latter, along with calligraphy and seal engraving. This work is one of a small number of landscapes that he produced towards the end of his life.  \n1975 年  \nHKUP.2015.2197_078  \n1976 年  \nHKUP.1993.0983  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_72_0.jpg)\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_72_1.jpg)",
