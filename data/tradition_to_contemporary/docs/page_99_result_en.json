    "document": "# Nancy CHU WOO (b. 1941)  \nAlpine Lake 1992 Horizontal scroll, ink and gouache on paper, 88 x 176.5 cm HKU.P.2007.2372  \nThe kaleidoscopic textural surface of this abstract landscape was created through the application of multiple layers of colour washes, splashed ink and opaque colours on absorbent xuan paper. The subtle and luminous chromatic effects were achieved through the use of rich blues, greens, oranges and browns. The colours may be a reference to vegetation surrounding an alpine lake, represented by the white void at the centre of the painting. Dark, moist ink used on the right side of the painting imbues the forms with a sense of lushness.  \nBetter known for her female nudes, Nancy Chu Woo's innovative landscapes often bring different mediums and artistic traditions into dialogue through colour, mixing ink with gouache to create semi- abstract compositions. A contemporary artist with a diverse background, Chu was born in Guangzhou and studied art in the United States before settling in Hong Kong in 1973. Her cross- cultural experiences and travels inform her diverse artistic style, which blends approaches and techniques from traditional Chinese painting and Western abstraction.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_99_0.jpg)",
