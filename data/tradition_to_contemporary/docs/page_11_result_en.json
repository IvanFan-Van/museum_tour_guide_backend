    "document": "Other painters in this category include Poon Chun- wah, Lucille Lo Yuk- yin, Marina Pang (ca. 1940) and Liew Come- tong, among others. They each have their own style, although most show the influence of modern Western composition and methods. For example, Marina Pang's Winter Wonderland (ca. 77) maintains an emphasis on brush- and- ink painting techniques seen in traditional Chinese painting, and also continues Chang Dai- chien's splash- ink painting technique. \n## The Lingnan School and the Guangdong Chinese Painting Research Society (Guangdong guohua yanjiu hui) \nA survey of the Hong Kong art world of the twentieth century shows that aside from traditional landscape painting and the works of Guangdong painters, what had the greatest influence on artistic circles in the Lingnan area was none other than the Lingnan School of painting. The Lingnan School advocated innovation and a middle road between East and West in terms of technique, creating a method of 'infusing water or powder' (zhanghui zhuangfen) to open up new possibilities for future development while transforming traditional Chinese painting and ink wash painting. \nAlthough the collection does not include works by the founders of the Lingnan School (Gao Jianfu, Gao Qifeng and Chen Shuren), it does include 'boneless' (mogu, a painting technique using ink and colour washes without outlines) bird-and-flower works by another founder Ju Chao (1811-1865) and his disciple Rong Zuchun (1871-1942). Ju Chao's style is typical of the mainstream Lingnan style of the time, while Rong Zuchun's style is representative of the Guangdong Chinese Painting Research Society (Guangdong guohua yanjiu hui).' The works by these two artists collected at HKU offer a perspective on how much the Lingnan School and the Guangdong Chinese Painting Research Society influenced Hong Kong and Guangdong painting circles during the mid- to late nineteenth century. \nRepresentative of the Lingnan School are works by second-generation artists such as Chao Shao-an's album leaf calligraphy Birds and Flowers (ca. 27), Li Xiongca's (1910-2001) Raffa on a Spring River (ca. 44) and Ye Shaobings's (1896-1908) gift to Chow Chiau-chiu and Chow Leung Chen-ying, Butterfly and Flowers (ca. 23); as well as works by third-generation artists such as Chiu Sai-kwong's (1916-2007) Emergent Lion (ca. 24), Chow Chiau-chiu (1910-2006) and Chow Leung Chen-ying's (1921-2005) The Alps (ca. 58) and Kingsfiler and Lotus (ca. 46), among others. \nMost of these artists lived, at least for a time, in Hong Kong. Among them, Chao Shao-an had the greatest influence on the Hong Kong art world. He began working as an art teacher after moving to Hong Kong at the age of thirty-three, and continued to teach for sixty-two years. He has numerous disciples and his name is well known in bird-and-flower painting. This publication includes ten bird-and-flower album leaves created between 1990 and 1991 (when Chao was eighty-seven and eighty-eight). These are works Chao himself thought quite highly of, done with freehand brushwork and lively, vivid images. They demonstrate his distinctive personal style and a steady, experienced hand. As Xu Beihong wrote in one of his poems: \"There are inheritors of the southern painting school, Mr Chao's birds and flowers are true to life; autumn winds impede this old rider, while bright spring light shines to enviable depths.\" Xu also praised Chao in a letter to Hu Shi: \"Mr Chao is the first in contemporary China in terms of his birds and flowers, there are few in the world to match him.\" Ye Shaobing's bird-and-flower painting style was similar to Chao's, using free brushstrokes and a 'boneless' (without outlines) style, along with coarse brushwork that gives his paintings a willfully unpolished look. \n\n",
