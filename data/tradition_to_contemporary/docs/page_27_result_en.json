    "document": "# LUO Anxian (active late 19th century)  \nCuckoos and a Kapok Tree 1870 Album leaf, ink and colour on paper, 30.5 x 55.6 cm Gift of Jill and Luke Tao HKLPJ2015.2184  \nTwo lyrical sentences highlight the contrast between red and green in this painting of birds sitting on a kapok tree. Though Luo Anxian states that the painting imitates the style of the early Ming bird-and-flower painter Lin Liang (ca. 1416- 1480), a Guangzhou painter at the imperial court, their styles are dissimilar, and the connection is not immediately obvious.  \nA native of Panyu in Guangdong province, little is known of Luo Anxian, who used the courtesy name Dengdao and the sobriquets Sanfeng and Yefeng. He was likely active in the late nineteenth century, during the regime of the Tongzhi (1861- 1875) and Guangxu (1875- 1908) emperors. According to a passage in Brief Accounts of Lingnan Painting (Lingnan hua zhenglie), Luo drew on the work of the Ming painter Wen Zhengming (1470- 1559) when painting landscapes, and was known for his skill at painting figures, grasses and insects.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_27_0.jpg)",
