    "document": "LI Jian (1747-1799) \nLandscape in the Six Dynasties Style \n1793 \nHanging scroll, \nink and colour on silk, \n108 x 47 cm \nHKU.P1966.0310 \nThis colourful autumnal landscape was painted with a combination of ink and mineral pigments, including malachite, gold and cinnabar. Autumn leaves and the robes of a scholar in a pavilion stand out in bright red, in pleasing contrast with the muted colours of the silk background. In the distance, the landscape of a mountain range appears in flat ink, applied using the 'boneless' technique (mogo) in which an ink wash is used directly without a delineating outline. In the inscription, LI Jian mentions his use of techniques developed in the Six Dynasties period (220-589 CE), particularly the boneless technique of Zhang Sengyou (479-7). Although no painting by Zhang Sengyou today, later Ming and Qing dynasty painters like Wei Zhengyan (1476-1559) made copies of his work. The thatched cottage and figure in the foreground appear similar to those painted by Wen Zhengming, suggesting that LI Jian may have imitated Zhang Sengyou through Wen Zhengming. \nA talented poet and celebrated painter, LI Jian was influenced by many earlier landscape painters, such as Ni Zan (1306-1374) and Shi Tao (1642-1707). He used several courtesy names, including Jianni and Weicai. Because he lived in a scenic area between the Dongqiao (East Firewood) and Xiaqiao ('West Firewood') mountains, he was also called 'Eriqiao' ('Two Firewoods'), and was known as one of the 'Four Partners of Lingnan', together with Zhang Jianling (1747-1792). Huang Danzhi (1757-1880) and Li Jian (1742-1813). Most of Li's paintings were produced during trips between his hometown of Shunde and Guangzhou, when Li would sell his works and teach to earn a living. The inscription on this work includes the name 'Village of Red Flowers', a village in Foshan not far from Guangzhou, where it was likely painted. \n1793 年 \nHKU.P.1966.0310 \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_21_0.jpg)",
