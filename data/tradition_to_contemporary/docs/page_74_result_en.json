    "document": "# LEUNG Kui-ting (LIANG Juting, b. 1945)  \nDyei Red 1976 Horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 60 x 61.5 cm Gift of the artist HKUP.2008.1713  \nDyei Red is an early work by Leung Kui- ting, a Guangzhou- born artist who moved to Hong Kong in 1948. Leung was heavily influenced by modern design principles and 'hard- edge painting', a term coined in 1959 to describe an approach to abstraction developed by California painters like Karl Benjamin (1925- 2012) in the 1960s. In contrast to the free mixture of colours and shapes employed in abstract expressionism, hard- edge painting features separate, clearly delineated areas of colour of particular sharpness and clarity. As the title suggests, this geometric abstract painting primarily consists of shades of red. The composition is clearly divided into four major areas of deep colour by a rough grid. At the time it was painted, Leung was exploring techniques such as dyeing, crumpling and sewing layers of paper. Unlike typical hard- edge paintings, the fields in this work mix different colours, but the gridlines remain visible beneath.  \nLeung's career was shaped by his teachers Lui Shou- kwan (1919- 1975) and Wucis Wong (b. 1936), who he studied with at the Department of Extramural Studies, CUHK between 1964 and 1969. After graduating, Leung taught design in the Swire School of Design at Hong Kong Polytechnic from 1975 to 1990, and founded the Hong Kong Chingying Institute of Visual Arts in 1980. With Wucis Wong, he co- authored the book Two- Dimensional Design- Fundamental Studies in 1982, which became a key text for design courses in Hong Kong.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_74_0.jpg)",
