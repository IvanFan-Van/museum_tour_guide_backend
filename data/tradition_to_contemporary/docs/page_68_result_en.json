    "document": "NG Yiu-chung (WU Yaozhong, b. 1935)  \nLandscape  \n1972  \nVertical scroll, ink and colour on paper, 185.1 x 96 cm HKUJP.2002.1412  \nThis bizarre landscape is full of surrealist fantasies that recall Joan Mitro's (1893- 1983) signature biomorphic forms and geometric shapes. The sky, washed in pale blue mixed with light orange, forms a direct contrast with the mountains and valleys below, which are built up with bold, even and short lines in ink. A brownish void depicts a vast stretch of water in the upper left of the painting, outlined by a meandering curve set into the side of the mountains. In the foreground, evocative and dynamic shapes with ink outlines appear almost to have been drawn randomly, floating like clouds above the mountains. The artist's signature appears in the lower right, mimicking the lines on the surface of the mountains.  \nNg Yiu-chung began to study modern ink painting under Lui Shou- kwan (1919- 1973) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 1968, enrolling in various art courses at both HKU and CUHK between 1967 and 1973. He was a founding member of both the One Art Group and the Ta Art Association, each comprised mostly of Lui's former students and supporters of the New Ink movement. In 1971, his work was selected for the Art Now Hong Kong traveling exhibition, which was shown in London, Edinburgh, Bristol, Manchester and other major cities in the United Kingdom.  \n1972年  \nHKUJP.2002.1412  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_68_0.jpg)",
