The artist has applied a sequence of washes in monochrome ink and colours to create forms of various shapes and sizes. Much of the colour has been heavily diluted with water, but bright colours like yellow and green stand out on the surface.  \nChui Tze- hung began working in a wide range of mediums, such as oil, watercolours, photography and sculpture in 1959. He was exposed to Western contemporary art through foreign art magazines such as ARTnews and Art in America, which he had access to as an employee of the Library of the Consulate General of the United States in Hong Kong. The American printmaker Joan Farra was a significant influence on his work, after studying with him in 1968, as was his teacher Lui Shou- kwari's (1919- 1975) direct to revistable Chinese painting. Chui also studied Chinese art and literature at China College in Hong Kong from 1962- 1965, under mentors such as Chao Shao- an, (1905- 1998) Pau Siu- yau (1892- 1985) and Pang Chap- ming (1908- 2002).  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_91_0.jpg)\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_91_1.jpg)",
