    "document": "Bai Juyi, the painting tactfully expresses Xu's sympathy for the misfortune of a female performer, his distress over corrupt officials and the stifling of individual talent. The composition and usage of ink and colour take full advantage of the expressiveness of traditional Chinese line drawing. With the addition of a faint wash of colour, it reproduces the traditional literary theme of 'the pipa player', and would have appealed to the interests of the Chinese Society.  \nUMAG also holds many works by Liu Haisu, who, like Xu Beihong, studied in France during the early Republican period. Before becoming familiar with Western painting techniques while in France, they already had a firm grasp on traditional Chinese painting; and with the goal of integrating Western art theory and techniques into traditional Chinese artistic works, they produced ink wash paintings that were 'Chinese with a Western Flair'.  \nThe university museum's collection includes two works produced by Liu Haisu in the 1980s, Mount Huang at Dawn (cat. 45) and Man Jiang Hong (Mount Huang) (cat. 51), done with freehand brushwork in full colour. They differ from the precise lines of Tang dynasty blue- and- green landscape paintings, and show Liu's realistic depictions of his visits to Mount Huang in the 1980s (when Liu was in his late eighties and nineties). Liu climbed Mount Huang ten times between 1918 and 1988, over a span of seventy years. 'The paintings of Mount Huang are the most important of his oeuvre. He employs oil painting techniques to create traditional Chinese paintings, as can be seen in Man Jiang Hong (Mount Huang), which he made after his last visit to the mountain in 1988.' Using mineral blue and green, he allows the colours to float on the ink, changing the way colour had been used; where the ink covers up any \nwhite space, white paint recolours the area. While subjectivity was common in works from the 1980s, he emphasised his spirited portrayals and stylistic expressiveness. Most of Liu's late landscape works integrate traditional blue-and-green compositions and freehand ink painting, employing a centre line to establish an underlying structure. He would sketch the outline of a portion of the mountains and incorporate a splash-ink and splash-colour (pomo poca) technique to provide the image with a unique indistinctness and a magnificently colourful and forceful character. These works also show his characteristic emphasis on realistic natural scenes and distinctive splash-ink and splash-colour methods. \nAnother nationally renowned artist is Lai Shaoqi (1915- 2000), who visited Hong Kong in December 1983 and donated the painting Mount Huang (cat. 48) to the Fung Ping Shan Library. The work comes from his middle- to- late period before he retired. Lai was the first to research and promote Huang Binhong's work, and the thick ink strokes and dense composition of Mount Huang resemble Huang's dark, dense, thick, heavy and abstruse 'Black Binhong' style, as in the painting Like 1945, painted when Huang was in his eighties. Lai Shaoqi was particularly good at capturing light and shadow, and mixing ink with colour. He also combined dense black ink and calligraphic lines in a slightly naive style, all of which is fully displayed in Mount Huang. \nFang Zhaoling's landscape and genre paintings display her personal style. For example, her 1988 work Landscape (cat. 52) employs an intense calligraphic brush along with her characteristic use of long inscriptions, which she has blended into the mountains. Dragon Boat Race (Ode to Peace, No. 6) (cat. 49) is richly coloured, appealingly unpolished and attractive in its innocence and childlike sweetness. \n4 His 1988 Black Tiger Pine is inscribed: \"Painting Black Tiger Pine and happening upon Li Keliang on my tenth climb up Mt Huang ...\" 5 Liu Haisu later spoke of his experience making this painting on his tenth trip up Mount Huang: \"I painted in the geotexture, with both ink and colour. But to capture the sense of Mount Huang, and wanting to express my own feelings, I splashed on the ink, sprinkled on the colour and used free brushstrokes. What I found most fascinating about my tenth ascent of Mount Huang was that the name of Mount Huang is found in his high cliffs, the danger of Mount Huang is found in its pine-covered ravines, the subtlety of Mount Huang is found in its contumities; the joy of Mount Huang is found in its light drizzle; the waterfall of Mount Huang are found in its splashes of water.\" http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_bc5d48180l2vupc.html.
