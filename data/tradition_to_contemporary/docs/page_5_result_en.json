Dimensions exclude mounting; height precedes width.  \nChinese names are given in the traditional order, surnames first, with the exception of artists who have adopted the Western order of surnames late. Traditionalization of Chinese personal names into English follows the Prym system of romanisation, in Cantonese or Mandarin depending on the more commonly used form. Chinese terms are italicised unless commonly used in English.  \n\n",
