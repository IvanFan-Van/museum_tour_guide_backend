It depicts a sea view with people on boats rowing. The backdrop features a mountainous landscape of blue dots and washes outlined with calligraphic brushstrokes. Painted with diluted red ink, the sun stands still above the top of the mountains.  \n## 53  \n## CHOW Chian-chiu (ZHOU Qianqiu, 1910-2006)  \nXin Pak at Mount Huang  \n1989 Horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 68.8 x 118 cm Gift of Professor Chee- woo and Grace Po- shan CHOW HKUP.2009.1829  \nXin Peak is particularly celebrated for its tall, vigorous pine trees and surreal beauty. The subject of numerous paintings, its appearance is often described as difficult to believe without first-hand experience. Chown swallowed in mist, the artist has hit large gaps between the mountains on the left and the pine trees on the right to represent clouds and to hint at the distance between peaks. An exceptionally tall pine tree on the right side of the painting draws the eye upward to a small, lone pine on the peak's summit.  \nChow Chian- chiu was a student of Chao Shao- an, a master of the Lingnan School, who was heavily influenced by Chao Shao- fook's sketching from life. He was particularly famous for his paintings of tigers, and later in life earned the honorific \"Tiger Chow.\" He married Leung Chen- ying (1921- 2005) in 1944 and the couple spent a lifetime travelling and painting the mountains and rivers. The inscription indicates that Chian- chiu painted this work in America in 1989, likely to serve as a record of an earlier visit to Mount Huang.  \n25 The late Ming dynasty poet Huang Xiyuan (active in the second half of the sixteenth and early seventeenth century) stated that his visit to the peak caused him to 'begin to believe' (shixin feng).  \nHKUP.1989.0957  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_88_0.jpg)\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_88_1.jpg)",
