    "document": "PANG Chap- ming (aka PANG Jop- ming or PENG Ximing, 1908- 2002) River, Mountains, Clouds and Mist 1995/1996 Horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 54.1 x 119.2 cm Gift of Ms Au Yee- lin HKUP.2005.1614  \nThis landscape features a river surrounded by monumental mountains, in sketchy but bold calligraphic lines of dark and light ink. Washes and dotting techniques give the geography texture and volume, while voids create areas of cloud and mist between the village and landscape. Peng's brushwork is traditional, but the spatial arrangement has a modern sensibility. His seal status that he \"visited with the spirit of heaven and earth\" while painting it, which helped him to explore his vision of an ideal landscape.  \nMany of Peng's works began with sketches of nature from his travels in China—particularly to famous mountains—and he often encouraged his students to observe nature by taking them to local scenic spots. He also painted from memory. During a period of seclusion at the Shangqing Monastery on Mount Qingcheng during the Second Sino- Japanese War (1937- 1945), he made the acquaintance of the painter Chang Dai- chien (1899- 1983) who gave him the name the \"Hermit of Painting\".  \nPeng had a keen grasp of classical taste, largely due to his family background. His mother, known as Madame Di, was the niece of the famous connoisseur and collector Di Pingu (1873- 1940). Through his connection, Peng was able to study thousands of original rubbings at the home of Gu Xieguan (1875- 1949), as well as many important private collections in Shanghai, including Di Pingu's. He refined his technique through copying and imitating works in these collections. Peng moved to Hong Kong from Shanghai in 1950, living in the New Territories, where he enjoyed a quiet life surrounded by nature. He taught many students, and most of his paintings were given as gifts to his students and friends.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_112_0.jpg)",
