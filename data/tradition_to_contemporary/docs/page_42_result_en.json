Leung Pak-yue, an artist from Shunde, Guangdong province, studied landscape painting with Li Yaoping (1883- 1937) and participated in the Chinese Painting Research Society in Guangzhou. After Guangqiao fell to the Japanese in 1938, he moved to Hong Kong and started a business producing imitations of ancient silk-woven tapestries, establishing a painting school in Kowloon in the 1950s.  \nA set of colophons above the paintings contains ancient aphorisms. They were written by Lu Xiangfu (1868- 1970), Gui Dian (1867- 1958), Cen Guangren (1876- 1960) and Au Kin-kung (No Jiangong, 1887- 1971). These four men were revered scholars in the Hong Kong calligraphic world. On Jiangong had the most far- reaching influence, as many shop signs bore his calligraphy. Such paintings were often hung in a hall, providing wisdom and inspiration, and serving as decorative elements.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_42_0.jpg)",
