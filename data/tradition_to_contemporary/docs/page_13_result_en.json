    "document": "Of the modern ink painters from the 1990s, the most well known here are Leung Kui- ting and Raymond Fung Wing- kee, both still active in Hong Kong. The paintings presented, A Flower Is Not A Flower and The Unforgettable Moment (cats. 73, 63), carry traces of traditional brush- and- ink works, and within the abstract style there are hints of an eastern worldview based on the balance and contrasts of yin and yang, maintaining a rootedness in tradition yet disrupting the boundaries between East and West.  \nThis form of balance and contrast, tradition and disruption, is quite similar to the role that the museum has played over the last sixty- five years in documenting Hong Kong's evolving and diverse art scene—first through its Museum of Chinese Art and Archaeology (established in 1953), then as the Fung Ping Shan Museum (from 1964) and finally through the increasingly more diverse exhibitions presented at UMAG (since 1994).  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_13_0.jpg)",
