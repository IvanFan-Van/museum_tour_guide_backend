    "document": "# Stanley AU Wai-cheung (b. 1947)  \nAbstract Landscape 1998 Vertical scroll, ink and colour on paper, 136.5 x 102.5 cm Gift of the artist HKU.P.1997.1177  \nThis abstract landscape appears to be a topographic view of a city or town. The angular composition is built from a lively arrangement of lines, squares, rectangles and other shapes. Composed of three vertical scrolls, the central block utilises nearly all of the space, while the scrolls on the left and right sides have large areas of empty space. The geometric shapes are outlined or washed in diverse ink tones, ranging from light grey to black—perhaps corresponding to plots of land used for different purposes.  \nPrior to his painting career, Stanley Au worked as a geotechnical engineer. His early works include traditional landscapes and bird-and-flower paintings, but he later moved toward abstraction. The topographic style of Abstract Landscape recalls his expertise as an engineer, underscoring a series of voids and solids that may be areas of sea and land.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_118_0.jpg)",
