    "document": "Joseph LOU Chunfu (1916- 7)  \nLandscape after Wang Meng 1953 Hanging scroll, ink and colour on paper, 101.3 x 40.5 cm HKU.P2015.21.43  \nLandscape after Wang Meng depicts a scholar in a landscape in the style of the noted Yuan painter Wang Meng (ca. 1308- 1385). Textured strokes give shape and volume to the surrounding mountains, with refined brushwork and delicate colouring that suggests an air of archaic calm. In the foreground, a scholar and his servant walk toward a cottage among tall trees. At impy, empty pavilion surrounded by clouds and mist hints at hidden paths leading into the mountains.  \nLou Guowei, better known by his courtesy name, Chunfu, was born into a scholarly family in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. He was inspired to take up painting by his father Lou Jing (courtesy name Bingzhang), a painter, calligrapher and collector. He moved to Hong Kong in 1949 and published an index of artists called the Ancient Chinese Painters' Reference Guide, which included paintings by him and his father, among others. He gave this painting to F. S. Drake (1892- 1974) a year after Drake was appointed a Professor of Chinese at HKU.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_44_0.jpg)",
