    "document": "# FANG Zhaoling (FANG Chao-ling, 1914-2006) \nSeven-Character Poem by Du Fu and Enjoying a Cup of Wine While Eating Crab \n1995 \nTwo fans mounted as a hanging scroll: \nFolding fan, ink on paper, \n23.6 x 62.8 cm. \nRound fan, ink and colour on paper, \ndiameter 47 cm \nGift of the artist \nHKU.1996.1222 \nThe upper fan is inscribed with a famous Tang poem by Du Fu (712-770), which describes a reunion between old friends in Jiangnan, south of the Yangtze River. The friends are aged, having lived working lives linked to the rise and fall of great empires. On the lower fan, a painting executed in a slightly awkward, childlike fashion, depicts two crabs on a plate and a pair of wine cups, outlined with linear calligraphic brushwork. The crabs are painted in the bonelets' method, using washes of colour without an outline. \nAlthough the calligraphy does not explicitly refer to the crab and wine depicted in the painting, both complement each other. Fang's hometown in southern China, which she thought of often, is also the home of the hairy crab. By depicting two crabs on the plate and two cups next to it, the painting implicitly suggests a reunion of friends. Fang made the two works in her eighties, and Du Fu's poem about old friends reuniting recalls her peripatetic existence and the experience of aging, while enjoying a leisurely artistic life. \n1995 年 \nHKU.P.1996.1222 \n# FANG Zhaoling (FANG Chao-ling,1914-2006) \nEight People and Two Horses \n1995 \nHanging scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n134.2 x 68.6 cm \nHKU.P.1996.1216 \nFang returned to the subject of horses many times throughout her career. In this painting, few small figures dance joyfully between two women on horses and a man standing on the left. The uplifting spirit of the work is accentuated by bright colours and the cheerful expressions on people's faces. The red beard woman standing behind the horse in the foreground is apparently the focus of the painting, being slightly larger and more prominently placed than the other figures. Her costume and horsesuit suggest that she is a normal, while the figure wearing a coat and trousers, sitting on the horse and looking out at the viewer, is a modern woman. Seals are playfully affixed on the figures, some of whom have auspicious wishes inscribed in the fabric of their clothes. \nFang was a skilled and versatile painter, but she was also industrious, working throughout the year. In this piece, the use of the horse—a traditional symbol of endurance in the face of hardship and labour—together with a seal which reads 'work has no income', emphasises the importance of diligent practice. In the inscription, Fang also highlights the calligraphic nature of her brushwork and lines. She also notes her original intention to paint a landscape with people and horses, which she decided against on a day of severe weather one and a half months after she drafted her painting, as well as her decision to apply colour instead of monochrome ink. \n<|/ref|><|det|>[[808, 325, 856, 338]]<|/det|>\n1995 年 \nHKU.P.1996.1216 \n\n",
