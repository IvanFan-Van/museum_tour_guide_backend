    "document": "JIA Tsung-i (RAO Zongyi, 1917- 2018) Landscape ca. 1957- 1968 Hanging scroll, ink on paper, 108.7 x 28 cm Gift of Jo Lo Yue HKUP.1997.1263  \nExecuted in a sketchy yet delicate manner, this early painting by Jo Tsung-i features tall mountains rendered with dry, calligraphic lines. The empty pavilion by the sea particularly recalls the work of Xu 2010- 1374), which is characterised by a sense of tranquillity and emptiness. While the expressive strokes and ambience echo Yuan stylistic traditions, Jo injects the work with a contemporary flavour by including several bongs at the far end of the sea parallel to the peak, and by adding mallows and reeds rendered in a contemporary manner to the foreground. The inscription at the top of the painting explicitly references these attempts to distinguish it from earlier paintings. It reads:  \n\"I used a bald brush to paint rough cliffs and boats on the waves, and added yellow water mallows and white reeds. I know] the people of the past would not have painted so shodily.\"  \nThe work reflects Jo Tsung-i's status as a scholar-artist and his interaction with Lo Hsiang-lin (1906- 1978), a renowned historian celebrated for his study of the Hakka people. Jo and Jo worked at the Department of Chinese Studies at HKU from 1952- 1968 and 1956- 1968, respectively. An inscription and seals on the painting reveal that it was presented as a gift to Lo sometime between 1957 and 1968.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_47_0.jpg)",
