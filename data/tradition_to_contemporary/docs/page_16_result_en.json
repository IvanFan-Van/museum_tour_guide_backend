    "document": "Kong as an international cosmopolis\". Lie selected forty of his most important works, encompassing landscapes, figures and flower paintings produced over the past seven decades, and presented them as gifts to HKU in support of research and exhibitions. Meanwhile, Mrs Liu Xia Yiqiao (1918- 2012) offered a permanent loan of a further forty paintings to HKU in order to facilitate a sponsorship scheme.  \nThe programme booklet of the presentation ceremony states that \"The art critic Laurence Binyon (1869- 1943), retired Keeper of Oriental Prints and Drawings at the British Museum) has written that Professor Liu's skill and achievements are equal to those of any contemporary Western master.\" Binyon was a leading scholar of Chinese painting in Britain. He collaborated with Liu Haisu, the distinguished playwright Shih- i Hsiung (1902- 1991) and other executive committee members to organise the Exhibition of Modern Chinese Painting, held at New Burlington Galleries in London from February 21 to March 25, 1935. An exhibition catalogue produced to accompany the exhibition includes an introduction by Liu Haisu on his views on the development, aesthetic principles and major schools of modern Chinese painting, including the Literary School, the Academic School, the Archaistic School and the Lingnan School. He stressed the importance of calligraphy as a way for modern Chinese painters to infuse personality, lyrical feeling and inner vision into their study of the old models. To him, the Literary School remained the most vital, while subtleties of handling and variations of brushwork were the most interesting features by which an educated Chinese might read the message of a painting.  \nOver the past two decades, UMAG has received many other important gifts of twentieth- century Chinese paintings in the literati tradition and the Lingnan School from living Chinese  \nartists and collectors. They include bird- and- flower paintings by Cantonese and Hong Kong painters such as Ju Chao (1811- 1865), Pau Siu- yau (1892- 1985), Chao- shao (1903- 1998) and his student Chow Chian- chiu (1910- 2006). Several works by Fang Zhaoling (1914- 2006), another student of Chao Shao- an, were gifts from the artist and form a significant part of the collection. They demonstrate her early studies of traditional Chinese painting and the Lingnan School (cat. 26) in the 1950s; her move to a more personal, expressive and semi- abstract style in the 1960s (cat. 32) and further stylistic developments over subsequent decades (cats. 67, 70, 71). As with Liu Haisu, Fang Zhaoling took part in a considerable number of international exhibitions, and was inspired by her extensive travels in the second half of the twentieth century. Her paintings and works of calligraphy also embody the personality, lyrical feeling and inner vision of an independent woman intellectual.  \nFang's interest in Chinese calligraphy began at the age of thirteen. Six years later, she studied bird- and- flower painting under Chen Jiuchun (1898- 1957) and traditional landscape painting under Qian Songyan (1899- 1985) in her hometown, Wuxi, Jiangsu province. She continued to study bird- and- flower painting under Chao Shao- an from 1950 to 1953 and joined her teacher to exhibit works in Japan and Europe, including the Mitsukoshi Department Store, Tokyo in 1951; the University of Leeds in 1953; and the Marlborough Fine Arts Gallery, London in 1954. In September 1956, she was admitted to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford to continue her research on the Verses of Chu (Chuci, an anthology of ancient Chinese poetry from the Warring States period, ca. 475- 221 BCE), which was related to her studies at HKU. During her time in Oxford and London, she became active in promoting her work and that of other twentieth- century Chinese masters to international audiences.  \n8 See the correspondence between Mrs Liu, Dr Michael Lau and other committee members in the UMAG acquisition file: Donation of Paintings by Mr Liu Haisu on January 21, 1992. 9 Liu 1935b, pp. 10- 17.  \n\n",
