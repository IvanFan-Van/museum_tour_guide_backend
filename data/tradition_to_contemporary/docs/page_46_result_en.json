He came to Hong Kong in 1947, where he taught at private schools and befriended many local artists. He painted this work before he returned to Guangzhou in 1957. Ye specialised in bird- and-flower paintings and was particularly fascinated by butterflies and flowers. This work demonstrates his distinctive brushwork and colours. The painting was a gift to Lingnan School painters Chow Chian-chiu (1910- 2006) and Chow Leung Chen-ying (1921- 2005) while Ye was in Hong Kong. \n1915 年 \nHKLPJ.2009.1844 \nCHU Sai-kwong (ZHAO Shiguang, 1916- 2007) \nEnraged Lion \nInscribed by Chao Shao-an in 1958 \nHanging scroll, \nink and colour on paper, \n184.5 x 80.4 cm \nGift of Ling Fung Art School \nHKLPJ.2018.2333 \nAn inscription by Chao Shao-an (1905- 1998) states that this work is a copy of a painting by Gao Qifeng (1889- 1933), one of the founders of the Lingnan School. Gao's original was made for the Sun Tat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou around 1946. It was one of several works made and collected for the hall, which centred on the theme of the revolution. The ferocious-looking lion represents the reformist spirit of the era. Gao studied in Japan when teachers of large animals were a force of Nihonga painters like Takeuchi Seiho (1864- 1942). Enraged Lion exhibits elements drawn from Nihonga (Japanese-style painting), combining Western realism and approaches to colour and light with traditional brushwork, materials and subject matter. \nChui Sai-kwong moved to Hong Kong from Chenghai, Guangdong province after fighting in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937- 1945). He studied under Chao Shao-an and was an early student of the Hong Kong Lingnan Art Studio. Most of his works feature birds, flowers, insects and fish, in the fresh colours of the Lingnan School. \nHKLPJ.2018.2333 \n\n",
