Despite its small size, the cliff face along the coastline appears overbearing. There is sincerity in the meticulous brushwork that recalls Wen Zhengning (1470- 1559) and Tang Yin (1470- 1524), two of the Four Masters of Ming Painting. It features a two- line inscription taken from Schiller at a Moment at the End of Spring, a poem by famed Tang courtesan Yu Xuanji (844- 871), which expresses thoughts on existing in the world while remaining undisturbed by its problems.  \nWu Deyi was a descendant of the Wu family, one of the four wealthiest families in Guangdong province during the late Qing dynasty. He studied at Lu Lu (1828- 1904) 'Garden of Ten Fragrances', which was filled with a large collection of paintings and calligraphy. Many of Wu's contemporaries met in the garden to study, paint and talk, including Rong Zuchun (1872- 1943) and Gao Jianfu (1879- 1951).  \n## 9  \n## WU Deyi (1864-1927)  \nLandscape 1912 Folding fan mounted as an album leaf, ink andcolour on paper, 23.8 x 51.8 cm Gift of Julia and Luke Tao HKUPJ2015.2183  \nSimilar to the 1912 Landscape, this fan painting depicts a boating scene. The inscription is taken from an early Qing dynasty poem by Wu Weiye (1609- 1672). The third and fourth lines of the original poem read: \"Yellow chickens and purple crabs may be accompanied by wine / red trees and green mountains send off the boats, hinting at the contrasting colours in Wu's Landscape. The tranquil setting, with red leaves in the foreground and green mountains in the background, conveys the refined sensibility of floating along a river in a small boat. In the background, the craggy surfaces of distant mountains are highlighted with distinctive textural strokes and horizontal dots called Mi- dots, named after the painters Mi Fu (1051- 1107) and Mi Youran (1086- 1165) who popularised their use. The trees in the foreground bend backwards in the wind, adding a sense of dynamism to the otherwise tranquil landscape.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_29_0.jpg)",
