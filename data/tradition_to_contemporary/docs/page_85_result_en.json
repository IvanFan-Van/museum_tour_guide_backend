    "document": "# HUANG Zhou (b. 1925)  \nDancer 1985 Horizontal scroll, ink and colour on paper, 96.4 x 123.3 cm Gift of the artist HKLP.1985.0870  \nBased on her attire, the female figure dancing joyfully at the centre of this painting is a Uighur from Xinjiang province. A male figure sits on her left, clapping his hands and admiring the performance. Forceful, vigorous brushstrokes give shape to her lively, whirling body, which turns from left to right. Hints of colour on the dancer's lips, earrings, necklace and hands highlight her features and gestures.  \nScenes of daily life in Xinjiang are a common theme in Huang Zhou's work. His figure style was informed by his studies under Zhao Wangyun (1906- 1971). Huang worked at Northwest Normal University and co- founded the Ministry of Culture's Research Institute of Traditional Chinese Painting in 1981. Four years later, Huang visited Hong Kong, giving a painting demonstration and lecture at the Fung Ping Shan Museum on April 9. He donated the painting to the museum soon after.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_85_0.jpg)",
