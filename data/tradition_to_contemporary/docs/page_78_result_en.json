    "document": "## LI Xiongcai (1910-2001)  \nRafts on the Spring River 1982 Horizontal scroll, ink on paper, 95.5 x 179 cm Gift of the artist HKU.P.1982.0866  \nLI Xiongcai painted this impromptu work after he visited the Fung Ping Shan Museum on April 15, 1982. It reflects his signature use of pine trees in picturesque landscapes. Rather than representing a specific location in Hong Kong, it shows rafts in a generic landscape. In the center of the painting, two long rafts are depicted with calligraphic curves that create a sense of rushing water. While the water's surface is largely left blank, the rafts animate the water and create effects of depth and volume. Li depicted rafts in a similar composition, but in a vertical format, in several other works painted in the same year.  \nA student of Gao Jiangfu (1879- 1951) at his Spring Slumber Painting Studio (Chun Fung Art Club) between 1927 and 1931, Li followed Gao's example of incorporating Western naturalism and contemporary subjects into traditional art forms. Together with Chao Shao-an (1903- 1998), Yang Shanshen (1913- 2004) and Guan Shanyu (1912- 2006), he became one of the most important artists of the second generation of Lingnan School painters. The four began to work collaboratively in Hong Kong in 1981, after Li and Guan arrived from Guangzhou (Chao and Yang had left for Hong Kong in the 1950s), continuing nearly one hundred pieces in the following year. The resulting exhibition held at the Fung Ping Shan Museum was a significant milestone in resuming artistic and cultural exchange between Lingnan painters in mainland China and Hong Kong.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_78_0.jpg)",
