    "document": "# LUI Shou-kwan (LÜ Shoukun, 1919-1975)  \nZen 1970 Vertical scroll, ink and colour on paper, 147.3 x 79.8 cm Gift of the artist HKU.P.2002.1408  \nLui Shou- kwan had a profound understanding of Chinese traditional art and philosophy. He was particularly interested in Buddhism and started to experiment with Zen paintings in 1968. Its expression as aestheticism with the idea of 'spiritual resonance' (qiyan zhengdong), formulated in the Six Principles of Chinese Painting (Huihua Lingli), an early sixth century text by the theorist Xie He (active ca. 500- 575). Through the thoughtful application of ink and wash, this was able to convey this quality in his paintings, inspiring spiritual contemplation and thoughts about timelessness.  \nIn this work, he used a broad brush and spontaneous brush strokes to create rectangular bands and overlapping shapes of varying sizes. The high- quality abstract paper has resulted in interesting staining effects and ink spots, which form random patterns. The use of red above the dark ink at the top of the painting is a signature of Lui's Zen series, representing Buddhist motifs like lotus buds.  \nThe series shares some of its subject matter and style with the Zen paintings of Taiwanese painter Liu Guosong (b. 1932), as well as the international abstract expressionism art movement. After it was shown overseas, Lui achieved international acclaim and went on to teach many artists who contributed to the Hong Kong- based New Ink movement, which sought to modernize traditional Chinese painting through the integration of various Western modern art forms and styles in a local context.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_66_0.jpg)",
