    "document": "Fang Zhaolong's second solo exhibition at HKU was widely covered in local newspapers and magazines in 1988. 15 She also informed her friends at home and abroad—including curators of Asian art at the British Museum and the Ashmolean Museum in England: the Museum of East Asian Art, Cologne; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the de Young Museum, San Francisco. In her introduction to the catalogue, Fang Zhaolong emphasised her relationship with three particular art teachers from the university: Qian Songyan, Chao Shao-an, and Chang Dai-chien, who invited her to travel to scenic spots in South America, demonstrated his brushwork, colouring and composition, and shared his views on painting and his evaluation of Chinese and Western art. Fang was deeply inspired by Chang Dai-chien's way of teaching—with frankness, great patience and sincerity. She wrote in 1988: \"from the way he conducted himself and treated others, I learned to persevere in my artistic pursuit against life's heavy odds.\" A widow with eight children, Fang returned to the theme of perseverance in the preface to another catalogue published in collaboration with HKU, Works by Fang Zhaolong (1992):  \n\"The trials and tribulations of life have provided me with many memories. Orphaned as a child, widowed in the prime of life, and surrounded by loneliness during those regular trips, which took me away from my children and loved ones, introspection has become a favourite pastime. Hardship has not only made me strong, but has enabled me to understand the true essence of life and heightened my creative aspirations.\"  \nJournalist Hugh Chilverton took note of Fang's strong personal qualities and adaptability in an exhibition review for the HKU Museum Society's inaugural exhibition in 1988: \"Fang Zhaolong, one of the most successful living Chinese artists, is a kind of Orpheus, re-making the landscape after her own vision, and giving turbulent life to inanimate matter.\" He was also impressed by Fang's landscape paintings from the 1960s- 1980s, which demonstrated \"wonderful free and energetic brushstrokes\" and \"three- dimensional form with colour\". 16 Interestingly, Chilverton discerned that \"The effect [of Fang Zhaolong's work] is often more striking than you find in the works of an artist like Lui Shou- kwan or in showy calligraphy because the energy of her landscapes is contained, like a tiger in a sack.\"  \nLui Shou- kwan (1919- 1975) was a master of Chinese ink painting and a pioneer in Hong Kong's New Ink movement. Like Lui Haisu and Fang Zhaolong, he also has strong ties to HKU. In 1985, the Fung Ping Shan Museum organised a retrospective exhibition of his work entitled Hong Kong in Ink Modes: Landscape Paintings by Lui Shou- kwan, with a detail of his Hong Kong Landscape (cat. 29) featured on the poster. The exhibition was held to commemorate the tenth anniversary of his death. It showed sixty paintings of Hong Kong landscapes in realistic and spontaneous styles. Fifty- two were early works executed in the 1950s and 1960s from the private collection of Mrs Lui Mui Sin Ping. 17 This catalogue includes three landscape paintings by Lui Shou- kwan that demonstrate his quest for innovation and transformation of artistic approaches, ideas and styles in the 1960s. 18 When depicting Hong Kong  \n15 See Yu 1988 and Turner 1988. 16 The list of recipients is included in Fang Zhaolong's correspondence to the Fung Ping Shan Museum, January 6, 1989 and the UMG exhibition file: Chinese Painting by Fang Zhaolong, September 24 to November 5, 1988.  \n17 Fang 1988.  \n18 Fang 1992, p. ix.  \n19 Chilverton 1988. 页61  \n19 Chilverton 1988, p. 61.  \n20 Ibid.  \n21 Ibid.  \n22 The exhibition attracted considerable media attention in local newspapers. See the news clipping in the UMG exhibition file: Hong Kong in Ink Modes: Painting by Lui Shou- kwan, 8 October to 13 December 1985.  \n23 In the 1960s, Lui Shou- kwan painted prolifically, exhibited his works widely in Hong Kong and abroad, and remained active as the most exhibited Chinese painter in Britain. He also published his ideas on Chinese painting and art education. In 1966, Lui resigned from the Hong Kong and Yumatei Ferry Company and was invited to teach Chinese ink painting at the Department of Architecture of HKU and at the Department of Extramural Studies, Chinese University of Hong Kong.
