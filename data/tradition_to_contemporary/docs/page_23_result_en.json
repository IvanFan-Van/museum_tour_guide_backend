    "document": "## JU Chao (1811-1865)  \nDustiar and Rocks  United  Folding fan mounted as an album leaf,  ink and colour on paper,  24.3 x 53.6 cm  Gift of Julia and Luke Tao  HKUP.D.2015.2186  \nThe rocks and daisies on each side of this fan are painted with notable differences in brushwork, ranging from rough to refined. They have a striking sense of vitality and intimacy—probably a result of the artist's practice of painting directly from nature, rather than the more typical method of imitating earlier works. Ju Chao's observational painting was likely informed by the work of Song Guanghao (active ca. 1824- 1878) and Sheng Jingyi (ca. 1764- 1833), two painters from Jiangsu province who sketched from nature and used the 'boneless' technique in their bird-and-flower paintings. They introduced these approaches to Guilin in the early nineteenth century, where Ju Chao lived in his youth.  \nAfter his death, Ju's former home in Gushan Village, Panyu (now Haizhou district, Guangzhou) was turned into a school by Ju Lian (1828- 1904), the younger cousin of Ju Chao and another noted painter. Students and teachers gathered at Ju's home, called the 'Garden of Ten Fragrances', where they developed the hugely influential Gushan School style, characterised by the practice of sketching directly from nature. Ju Chao and Ju Lian also employed an innovative technique in which water and white powder were added to still- drying patches of ink- wash and colour wash, mixing together to create interesting lighting effects.  \n\n![](tradition_to_contemporary/page_23_0.jpg)",
