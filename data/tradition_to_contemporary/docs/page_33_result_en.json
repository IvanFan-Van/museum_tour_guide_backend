The first features the work of Li Shan (1686- 1762), a Yangzhou School painter from the Qing dynasty. The second bears a poem by the Tang poet Bai Juyi (772- 846), though Rong mistakenly attributes it to Li Shan. The flowers and fruits in the paintings are varieties popular in Guangdong.  \nRong studied bird- and- flower painting for eighteen years with Ju Lian (1828- 1904), one of the founders of the Gushan School, by Cai's teacher Fenggezong's (a male wise varsity of plants, which gave his students many opportunities to observe and sketch from mature using various techniques.
