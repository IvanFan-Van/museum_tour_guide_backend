       "[Document(metadata={'title': 'Hard-paste porcelain', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard-paste_porcelain'}, page_content='Hard-paste porcelain, sometimes called \"true porcelain\", is a ceramic material that was originally made from a compound of the feldspathic rock petuntse and kaolin fired at a very high temperature, usually around 1400 °C. It was first made in China around the 7th or 8th century and has remained the most common type of Chinese porcelain.  \\nFrom the Middle Ages onwards, it was very widely exported and admired by other cultures and fetched huge prices on foreign markets. Eventually Korean porcelain developed in the 14th century and Japanese porcelain in the 17th, but other cultures were unable to learn or reproduce the secret of its formula in terms of materials and firing temperature until it was worked out in Europe in the early 18th century and suitable mineral deposits of kaolin, feldspar, and quartz were discovered. This soon led to a large production in factories across Europe by the end of the 18th century. \\nDespite the huge influence of Chinese porcelain decoration on Islamic pottery, historic production in the Islamic world was all in earthenware or fritware, the latter having some of the properties of hard-paste porcelain. Europeans also developed soft-paste porcelain, fired at lower temperatures (around 1200 °C), while trying to copy the Chinese, and later bone china, which in modern times has somewhat replaced hard-paste around the world, even in China.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nChinese porcelain began to be exported to Europe by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch from the middle of the 16th century, creating vast demand for the material. The discovery in Europe of the secret of its manufacture has conventionally been credited to Johann Friedrich Böttger of Meissen, Germany, in 1708, but it has also been claimed that English manufacturers or Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus produced porcelain first. Certainly, the Meissen porcelain factory, established 1710, was the first to produce porcelain in Europe in large quantities and since the recipe was kept a trade secret by Böttger for his company, experiments continued elsewhere throughout Europe. Vienna porcelain became the second European manufacturer in 1718, followed by Vezzi porcelain in Venice in 1720.\\n\\nIn 1712, the French Jesuit François Xavier d\\'Entrecolles described the Chinese process of manufacturing porcelain in his letters to Europe. In 1771, the comte de Milly published L\\'art de la porcelaine, a detailed account of the processes of creating hard-paste porcelain, ending its prestige as a rare and valuable material.\\nHard-paste now chiefly refers to formulations prepared from mixtures of kaolin, feldspar and quartz. Other raw materials can also be used and these include pottery stones, which historically were known as petunse although this name has long fallen out of use.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\nHard-paste porcelain is now differentiated from soft-paste porcelain mainly by the firing temperature, with the former being higher, to around 1400 °C, and the latter to around 1200 °C. \\nDepending on the raw materials and firing methods used, hard-paste porcelain can also resemble stoneware or earthenware. Hard-paste porcelain can also be used for unglazed biscuit porcelain. \\nIt is a translucent and bright, white ceramic.  Hard-paste has the advantage over soft-paste that it is less likely to crack when exposed to hot liquids, but the higher firing temperature of hard-paste may necessitate a second \"glost\" firing for the decoration.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n\"The Invention of Hard-Paste Porcelain\" archived from Teapots.net.\\n\"Hard paste porcelain\" at The Potteries.og\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Hardpasteporcelain.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Lettre_du_pere_Entrecolles_1712_du_Halde_1735.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Nicolas-Christiern_Milly_1771_L%27art_de_la_porcelain_illustration.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Nicolas-Christiern_Milly_1771_L%27art_de_la_porcelain_title.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'title': 'Overglaze decoration', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overglaze_decoration'}, page_content='Overglaze decoration, overglaze enamelling, or on-glaze decoration, is a method of decorating pottery, most often porcelain, where the coloured decoration is applied on top of the already fired and glazed surface, and then fixed in a second firing at a relatively low temperature, often in a muffle kiln. It is often described as producing \"enamelled\" decoration. The colours fuse onto the glaze, so the decoration becomes durable. This decorative firing is usually done at a lower temperature which allows for a more varied and vivid palette of colours, using pigments which will not colour correctly at the high temperature necessary to fire the porcelain body. Historically, a relatively narrow range of colours could be achieved with underglaze decoration, where the coloured pattern is applied before glazing, notably the cobalt blue of blue and white porcelain. \\nMany historical styles, for example mina\\'i ware, Imari ware, Chinese doucai, and wucai, combine the two types of decoration. In such cases the first firing for the body, underglaze decoration and glaze is followed by the second firing after the overglaze enamels have been applied.\\nThe technique essentially uses powdered glass mixed with coloured pigments, and is the application of vitreous enamel to pottery; enamelled glass is very similar but on glass. Both these latter two are essentially painting techniques, and have been since they began. In contrast, on metal painting in enamel arrived very late, long after techniques such as cloisonné, where thin wires are applied to form raised barriers, which contain areas of (subsequently applied) enamel, and champlevé, where the metal surface is sunk to form areas where the enamel is poured.  \\nIn Chinese porcelain, enamels were and are sometimes applied to unglazed pieces; this is called \"enamel on the biscuit\" and similar terms.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nEnamel was used in jewellery, applied to metal, from very early on: there are examples in the Tomb of Tutankhamun of c. 1325 BC. Enamel was also used to decorate glass by the time of the Roman Empire. Applied to pottery, it is first seen in Persian mina\\'i ware from the late 12th century, using a group of seven main colours. Presumably the potters learnt the technique from glassmakers.\\nSlightly later it appeared in Chinese ceramics in Cizhou stoneware from as early as the 13th century, with use on porcelain following within a century, though it did not become predominant until later, and the full possibilities were not realized until the 17th and 18th centuries in the famille jaune, noire, rose, verte group of palettes. Some techniques use thin metal leaf, including mina\\'i ware as well as the more usual pigments, which are typically applied in a liquid or paste form, painted by brush, or using stencils or transfer printing. The Japanese kakiemon style, and other Japanese styles, used the technique from at least the second half of the 17th century. The technique was also developing in Europe, firstly in what the French called petit feu faience, and in the 18th century in porcelain, and there appears to have been some influence in both directions between Asia and Europe. From about 1770 to the mid 20th century it was the dominant decorative technique in expensive pottery, mostly porcelain, made in Europe, East Asia, and (to a lesser extent) North America.  \\nIn 18th-century England, where the technique was developed, the earliest forms of transfer printing on pottery, for example by Sadler & Green in Liverpool, were overglaze, although by the end of the century it was normal to print as underglaze.   \\nToday overglaze decoration is much less commonly used, other than in traditionalist wares, as the range of colours available in underglaze has greatly expanded. Overglazes called \"lusters\" are still used for achieving special effects, such as iridescence of mother-of-pearl overglazes or metallic look of overglazes made with metal (eg. gold) particles.\\n\\n\\n== Muffle kilns ==\\nThe kiln used for the second firing is usually called a muffle kiln in Europe; like other types of muffle furnaces the design isolates the objects from the flames producing the heat (with electricity this is not so important). For historical overglaze enamels the kiln was generally far smaller than that for the main firing, and produced firing temperatures in the approximate range of 750 to 950 °C, depending on the colours used. Typically, wares were fired for between five and twelve hours and then cooled over twelve hours. \\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nHughes, G Bernard, The Country Life Pocket Book of China, 1965, Country Life Ltd\\nNeedham, Joseph (ed), Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 5, Part 12, 2004, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521838339, 9780521838337, google books\\nVainker, S.J., Chinese Pottery and Porcelain, 1991, British Museum Press, 9780714114705\\nWatson, Oliver, \"Pottery under the Mongols\" in Beyond the Legacy of Genghis Khan, 2012, BRILL, Ed.

       " Document(metadata={'title': 'Maya ceramics', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_ceramics'}, page_content='Maya ceramics are ceramics produced in the Pre-Columbian Maya culture of Mesoamerica. The vessels used different colors, sizes, and had varied purposes. Vessels for the elite could be painted with very detailed scenes, while utilitarian vessels were undecorated or much simpler. Elite pottery, usually in the form of straight-sided beakers called \"vases\", used for drinking, was placed in burials, giving a number of survivals in good condition.  Individual examples include the Princeton Vase and the Fenton Vase.\\nUsed for a plethora of daily activities, such as the storage of food and beverages, ceramics were also a canvas of commemoration. There were three main types of ceramics used in daily life: bowls, plates, and cylinders. They were often monochrome, meaning that only one type of mineral slip was used. Polychrome pottery was more complex in nature and therefore more commonly used by the elite. Not only was polychrome pottery used as decoration, it was also used as a form of social currency—a physical display of status and others\\' approval.\\nAs time progressed, various features were added to ceramics to go beyond the fundamental needs of vessels; For example, pellets were put in larger bowls to not only serve as something to hold food, but would also become instruments used in the same feasts.\\nArchaeological evidence has been found that suggests ceramics were used for industrial purposes. The discovery of highly uniform ceramic cylinders along with tools used in the production of salt indicate that the ceramics were used to mass-produce salt from brine.\\nSurveys of Maya ceramics a major part of the ongoing controversy over the degree of elite political control over aspects the subsistence economy, the extent of economic centralization, and how it reinforces power (a common debate in the archaeology of complex societies).\\n\\n\\n== Typology ==\\nAs defined and used by Southwestern archaeologists, a ware is \"a large grouping of pottery types which has little temporal or spatial implication but consists of stylistically varied types that are similar technologically and in method of  manufacture\", and \"a defined ware is a ceramic assemblage in which all attributes of paste composition (with the possible exception of temper) and of surface finish remain constant.\" Generally each pottery classification and terminology system then becomes rather specific to a particular archaeological site and/or period.\\nA classification system can be epistemologically useful:\\n\\nWhat does a ceramic system “mean”? Most obviously, it means that Postclassic Petén potters recognized and adhered to a decorative canon—a set of rules—for design structure, layout, and colors. Vessel forms and proportions varied from ware to ware and settlement to settlement, but the principles\\nthat structured what kinds of decoration were to be applied, and where and how, were strictly adhered to in at least three production resource-groups (minimally defined by paste compositions) throughout the lakes area (approximately seventy-five kilometers east–west) over three hundred years. In addition, we were eventually able to successfully predict the decorative types we would find (which would otherwise be a process of categorization) in each ceramic group. \\nA type-variety classification system\\'s criticisms include that it leaves a lot of variability unaccounted for, it should be accompanied by modal analysis, and it has limited use with whole vessels.\\n\\n\\n=== Petén Lakes Postclassic system ===\\n\"Postclassic slipped and decorated pottery at sites in the Petén Lakes region was manufactured of three distinctive paste wares. These indicate minimally three production nodes of Petén Postclassic pottery, at least one for each paste. ... These paste wares were used to manufacture the three most common red-slipped ceramic groups of the Postclassic.... [P]otters across the Petén Lakes area had a fairly uniform and widely shared set of ideas about what constituted proper pottery decoration regardless of their different clay and temper resources.\"\\n\\nVitzil Orange-red Ware: coarse red-orange carbonate; used to manufacture Augustine ware.\\nSnail-Inclusion Paste Ware: silty gray-to-brown with snail inclusions; used to manufacture Paxcamán ware.\\nClemencia Cream Paste Ware: marly “white” or cream; used to manufacture Topoxté ware.\\n\"Whether painted or incised, decoration appeared in circumferential bands on the interior walls of tripod dishes (Rice 1983, 1985, 1989). The bands are defined above and below by multiple lines and divided into two or four panels by vertical lines or placement of simple motifs, which also may appear inside the panels (see Rice and Cecil 2009). This decorative coherence structures the classificatory coherence of types and varieties in the slipped ceramic groups across the three paste wares: monochrome, black-painted, red-painted, and incised.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Chocholá style ===\\n\\nNorthern Yucatán; as they did not come directly from digs they are often \"labeled as \\'unprovenanced\\' and hence \\'unusable\\'. ... In 1973, the name Chocholá was first assigned to the waxy, chocolatey, bowls and cylinders, which due to their uniquely carved surfaces, stand out from the majority of ancient Maya ceramics. ... Coe named the style after a small village 30 kilometers southwest of Mérida, near the larger settlement of Maxcanu, from which he was told the ceramics originated\"\\n\"On a significant number of Chocholá pots the decorative information is restricted to hieroglyphics, either the diagonal band described above, or a more elaborate combination of diagonal glyph bands, rim texts, or a single large Calendar Round date.\" The Primary Standard Sequences are text that occurs usually as a rim text on many ceramic vessels from all parts of the Maya Lowlands. The PSS is a glyphic formula that refers to the dedication of a vessel, its method of adornment, the class of vessel involved, its use and content (cacao drinks and maize gruels), and sometimes the owner or artisan.\\n\\n\\n=== Monte Albán typology ===\\nA ceramic classification by paste color and texture first defined in Caso et al. 1967 is commonly used: gris (gray, abbreviated \"G\"), crema (cream, abbreviated \"C\"), café (brown, abbreviated \"K\"), and amarillo (yellow or orange, abbreviated \"A\"). \"Most ceramic types produced after the founding of Monte Albán are designated by an alphanumeric code indicating their ware and type number (e.g., G.12, C.11, K.17, A.9). In contrast, ceramic types dating to pre-Monte Albán phases generally have descriptive names (e.g., Socorro Fine Gray, Atoyac Yellow-White). Although Oaxaca archaeologists do not formally assign these types to the four ware categories defined by Caso et al. (1967), similar gray, brown, and buff/cream pastes were used by earlier (Middle Formative) potters, and several pre-Monte Albán types clearly were \"ancestral\" to particular types in the Monte Albán sequence (e.g., Drennan, 1976: 22; also Flannery and Marcus, 2005: 473; 2015: 115–116).\"\\n\\n\\n==== Crema ware (cream) ====\\n\\nDesigns could be incised or carved post-firing. \"In the Rosario phase and Early MA I, production loci generally produced both “costly” and utilitarian vessels. By Late MA I, the production of costly vessels was dominated by potters in the Cacaotepec-Atzompa locality northwest of Monte Albán, who specialized in the manufacture of elaborate cream ware (crema) vessels, while other communities produced primarily (though not exclusively) utilitarian vessels. We suspect that these patterns reflect the efforts of rulers at Monte Albán to control the production and distribution of elite pottery, particularly crema vessels.\"\\n\"Many other sites in which crema-ware ceramics were found were interpreted to have had close ties to Monte Albán, because these ceramics were only produced from clay sources located near the ancient city.\" The distribution of crema ware in combination with other archaeological evidence suggests \"efforts by the leaders of Monte Albán to control, perhaps because of trade, the valleys lying between the Valley of Oaxaca and the coast.\"\\n\\n\\n==== Gris ware (gray) ====\\n\\n\\n==== Cafe ware (brown) ====\\n\\n\\n==== Amarillo ware (yellow or orange) ====\\n\\n\\n=== Slate ware ===\\ncharacterized by its waxy and lustrous surface finishing, Late Classic to Early Postciassic in northwestern Yucatán peninsula. one of the most sophisticated ceramic traditions of Northern Yucatán, and encompasses a multitude of elite wares.\\n\\n\\n=== Color types: red ware, orange ware, polychrome ===\\n\\n\\n=== Gralisa ware ===\\n\"A distinctive incised and graphite-painted red ware pottery known only from Bajos de Chila and four other sites on Oaxaca’s central coast.\" Their great abundance and variety in Bajos de Chila and the Guatemala highlands have suggested a possible greater extent of Maya trade and influence, but Oaxaca coast excavations have been limited.\\n\\n\\n=== Chocolate pots ===\\nSpouted vessels of the Middle Preclassic (1000–400 B. C.) and Late Preclassic (400 B. C.-A. D. 250) Maya are traditionally called \"chocolate pots\", but lacked direct evidence that they had use in association with cacao until recently.\\n\\n\\n=== Unique styles ===\\nStamped or mould-made pottery are generally rare among Maya ceramics.\\n\\n\\n== Decoration ==\\nThe utilitarians ware of the common people usually had simple decoration that reflected its use. Vessels in the palace were more elaborately decorated by carved forms or highly skilled polychrome paintings with hieroglyphs which named their function, the patron and rarely, the artist signature. For example, cylindrical bowls used for cacao drinks often had the plant species Q. guatemalteca depicted on them because that flower was used to enhance the flavor of the cacao drink. Designs often included rituals, supernatural figures or common day practices. Rulers were often depicted next to deities and shown to be equal, or nearly equal, in power and status as them. Other pots functioned more as storytelling devices, with glyphs from the Maya script that likely were guides for songs or other ritualistic texts.\\nFor many potters, decoration and imagery was more important than the structure of each vessel. Cylindrical vases and plates were popular because they maximized the surface area for storytelling through imagery on each piece. There was more evolution in pictorial representations than shapes. As the complexity of painting increased, vessel shapes remained fairly simple. Different regions in Mesoamerica also featured different color schemes regarding the area. In Holmul the color scheme surrounded reds and oranges on a white background. Black backgrounds often indicate supernatural forces featured in the plate\\'s scene or the depiction of the underworld because of the dark color used. Different regions also featured a variety of regional symbols depicted on pottery. In Tikal, the Tikal Dancer represents the young Maize God, often depicted with his arms outspread and one leg bent, and has been seen on eighty-two compiled plates. The Maize God was incredibly important to Maya culture because the god not only symbolized the Maya\\'s main resource but rebirth as well. In the Popol Vuh, the Maize God is represented in a cyclical nature in order for the Maya to understand the human life cycle. By placing an important figure in Maya culture onto pieces of pottery, it provides a higher importance of the pottery itself and its purpose. The Holmul Dancer, although similar to the Tikal Dancer in positioning, features a male dancing with a small dwarf or hunchback figure off to one side and has been seen on forty-five compiled vessels. Although the decoration had a higher importance, structure was still taken in to account. Specific pieces often featured other characteristics such as rattle feet, hollow cylinders located on the bottom of the plate that hold a ball on the inside. The rattle feet were often used for ritual purposes in the form of music because when shaken, the plate rattles. Pieces created with a diameter over 0.3m were often used for ceremonial feasts and those with smaller diameters, often including jars, were used for storage.\\n\\n\\n== Ceramics in society ==\\nMaya ceramics are made from two main types of materials that relate to their social structure, limestone and volcanic ash. Most of the land around the Mayans was limestone, which is where calcite comes from. These were mainly made as gifts and given to make local alliances, and these vessels are found in a more localized area. Whereas the ones made from volcanic ash are more widespread because they were thought to be given as gifts from the upper class to make very large alliances, through the Maya trade systems.\\nAlthough the Maya are well known for creating a multitude of art, they are perhaps most well-known for their pottery. The Maya used these potteries to perform their sacrifice rituals with melodic tones. Because these rituals were a way of praying for rain, the blood spilled by the sacrificial victim (frequently a prisoner of war) was a form of asking their gods for rain and bounty in agriculture. Since these two components are connected, with rain, the Maya would have grown along with their agriculture.\\nCeramics played a big role in society during the Maya Classic Period, when the Maya elite used ceramics not only to give gifts to foreign dignitaries, but they were also used in feasts during the Classic Period. Specialized pottery was made for the graves of nobles. Not anyone could make this pottery as it was very important they knew about the Maya history, mythology, and more. On these ceramics, intricate scenes were depicted which showed the palace life of the elite. The decorative scenes needed to feature the elite because they were the primary customers and wanted to have artwork that featured themselves. On each ceramic piece near the rim, its contents would be listed out, a type of beverage for a vase or food for a plate, then who it belonged to was written next. The rim also may feature Saurian head labels which may indicate a specific location where the piece was made or where the scene on the piece took place. Since these ceramics were traded and gifted, many end up in differing environments. In Teotihuacan, many ceramics from Tikal have been found due to being traded between traveling merchants between different cities in Mesoamerica. Specialists mainly pay attention to the writing, drawings, and hieroglyphs, since they were different for the different people and cultures they were made by. As for the everyday use more simple ware was made, generally of only one color, and would be produced in large quantities for the general public use. Maya pottery only weakly correlates to socio-economic levels of Maya society because of the value the culture emphasized ceramics. Rituals were where the Maya registered status rather than in pottery.\\n\\n\\n== Economics ==\\nThere is evidence in Postclassic Oaxaca that there was significant local production and trade of ceramics independent of the markets at the region imperial capital of Tututepec.\\n\\n\\n== Production techniques ==\\n\\nThe Maya had specific techniques to create, inscribe, paint, and design pottery. To begin creating a ceramic vessel the Maya had to locate the proper resources for clay and temper. The present-day indigenous Maya, who currently live in Guatemala, Belize and southern Mexico still create wonderful ceramics. Prudence M. Rice provides a look at what the current Guatemalan Maya use today for clay.  Highland Guatemala has a rich geological history comprised mainly from a volcanic past. The metamorphic and igneous rock, as well as the sand and ash from the pumice areas provide many types of tempering.  In the area, there are a range of clays that create varied colors and strengths when fired.  Today\\'s Maya locate their clays in the exposed river systems of the highland valleys.  It is hypothesized that the ancient people obtained their clay by the same method as today\\'s Maya. The clays are located in exposed river systems of the highland valleys.  Most likely, due to the climatic similarities over the last millennia it is likely that these same deposits or similar ones could have been used in early times.\\nOnce the clay and temper were collected, pottery creation began. The maker would take the clay and mix it with the temper (the rock pieces, ash, or sand). Temper served as a strengthening device for the pottery. Once worked into a proper consistency, the shape of the piece was created.\\nA potter\\'s wheel was not used in creating this pottery.  Instead, they used coil and slab techniques. The coil method most likely involved the formation of clay into long coiled pieces that were wound into a vessel.  The coils were then smoothed together to create walls. The slab method used square slabs of clay to create boxes or types of additions like feet or lids for vessels. Once the pot was formed into the shape, then it would have been set to dry until it was leather hard. Then, the pot was painted, inscribed, or slipped. The last step was the firing of the vessel. Kilns were used to fire the vessels, and they were normally found outside in the open air. Unlike many modern kilns, they were fired by wood, charcoal, or even grass.\\nLike the Ancient Greeks, the Maya created clay slips from a mixture of clays and minerals. The clay slips were then used to decorate the pottery. By the fourth century, a broad range of colors including yellow, purple, red, and orange were being made. However, some Mayan painters refrained from using many colors and used only black, red, and occasionally cream. This series of ceramics is termed the \"Codex Style\", it being similar to the style of the Pre-Columbian books.\\nFrom the 5th century onwards, post-firing stucco was adopted from Teotihuacan. By preparing a thin quicklime, the Maya added mineral pigments that would dissolve and create rich blues and greens that added to their artistic culture. The original use of the Maya Blue that is so well known was for ritualistic purposes in pre-Columbian times by combining indigo, copal, and palygorskite to burn as incense which left a blue hue used for many other types of art later on in Maya history. Many times this post-fire stucco technique was mixed with painting and incising. Incising is carving deeply or lightly into partially dried clay to create fine detailed designs. This technique was mostly popular during the Early Classic Period.\\n\\n\\n== Development chronology ==\\n\\nThe Maya were a diverse people whose culture has developed through the centuries.  As they developed, so did their pottery.  Archaeologists have found stages of commonality between types of ceramics, and these phases coincide with the Mayan timeline.\\nMiddle Preclassic (900/800-250 BC) Late Preclassic (250 BC- AD 250) Early Mayan ceramics stemmed from a past that began even years before the Maya became a group. Originally, the early Maya used gourds cut into useful shapes to create vessels to carry liquids and foodstuffs. These portable and durable gourds made excellent containers. The first ceramics closely resembled gourds and many were decorated with rocker stamps and simple slips. During the Late Preclassic period, many of the ceramics took on appendages of tetrapod mammiform supports. These supports were four legs underneath the pot holding it up. Tetrapods are relatively rare in the Maya Lowlands- even in the Peten where they were first described.  Characteristic cream-on-red stripes colored these unique vessels.\\nThe pottery of the Maya Early Classic dated from AD 250 to 550. The Maya soon began using polychrome slip paint, meaning they used many different colors to decorate the pots. This method of decoration became almost homogeneous for Mayan potters, thus signaling the beginning of the Classic Period. Across the Classic period, Maya pottery has little comparisons between its assemblages. Polychrome pottery was a luxury item not commonly available to the general population.  Most Early Classic Ceramics were monochrome types.  Figural Polychromes were an elite prerogative, probably produced by and for other elites.  The Classic Period of the Maya provided beautiful ceramics in many forms. The lidded basal flange bowl was a new style of potter to add to the already growing repertoire.  This type vessel usually had a knob on top in the form of an animal or human head, while the painted body of the animal or human spreads across the pot. Many of these pots also had mammiform supports, or legs. These unique vessels are usually found in great condition signaling a ritual function.  The reason many are in good condition is their frequent use as burial goods.  As such, they are often the target of looters who cut deep trenches through many Maya buildings in search of a marketable vessel.\\n\\n\\n== Sample timelines ==\\n\\nThere is no \\'standard\\' timetable for Maya ceramics.  There is significant variability in timing and content between sites.  The first table below lists the ceramic complexes for Uaxactun (1955, modified, 2000), and may not apply to any other site.\\n\\nVersion of a Maya ceramic timetable, adapted from a tourist booklet for Chichen Itza, 1984, based on Valliant\\'s work from 1927, and modified from Smith\\'s 1955 work at Uaxactun.  It is a mix of phases, types, and technology, and therefore of no indicative value.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nAimers, James John (2013).

       " Document(metadata={'title': 'Famille jaune, noire, rose, verte', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famille_jaune,_noire,_rose,_verte'}, page_content='Famille jaune, noire, rose, verte are terms used in the West to classify Chinese porcelain of the Qing dynasty by the dominant colour of its enamel palette. These wares were initially grouped under the French names of famille verte (\"green family\"), and famille rose (pink family) by Albert Jacquemart in 1862. The other terms famille jaune (yellow) and famille noire (black) may have been introduced later by dealers or collectors and they are generally considered subcategories of famille verte. Famille verte porcelain was produced mainly during the Kangxi era, while famille rose porcelain was popular in the 18th and 19th century. Much of the Chinese production was Jingdezhen porcelain, and a large proportion were made for export to the West, but some of the finest were made for the Imperial court.\\n\\n\\n== Famille verte ==\\n\\nFamille verte (康熙五彩, Kangxi wucai, also 素三彩, Susancai), adopted in the Kangxi period around 1680, uses green in a few different shades and iron red with other overglaze colours. It developed from the wucai (五彩, \"five colours\") style, which combines underglaze cobalt blue with a few overglaze colours. The famille verte enamels may be painted on the biscuit (unglazed pre-fired ware) with no underglaze blue, or over high-fired glaze, producing wares of different appearances. Wares with enamel painted on the biscuit usually have a solid-colour ground such as yellow, black or green, while those painted over the glaze may have a white ground. Occasionally both underglaze and overglaze blue may be seen in the same object. The firing to fuse the enamels was done at a relatively low temperature.\\nThe colours found in famille verte are typically green, red, yellow, blue and aubergine (non-vivid purple). Black may also be used and occasionally gold. The blue colour is more violet or royal blue in tone, which is different in shade from the blue used in Ming dynasty porcelain. The ability to achieve colour gradation famille verte is limited. The coloured enamels are often painted over the pure white body of the porcelain which comes over through the glaze. The colours may also be set off on black or yellow grounds (known as famille noire and famille jaune respectively), and more rarely aubergine and green.\\nFamille verte wares were popular for several decades until the 1720s after the reign of Kangxi when it became supplanted by famille rose which has a greater colour range. It continued to be made in small amounts in the subsequent periods, and its popularity revived in the West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\\n\\n\\n=== Famille jaune ===\\nFamille jaune is a variation of famille verte, using famille verte enamels on a yellow ground.\\n\\n\\n=== Famille noire ===\\nFamille noire (Chinese: 墨地素三彩, Modi susancai) uses a black ground. Genuine famille noire wares were made in the Kangxi era, although some clobbered wares had the black added to famille verte porcelain in the 19th century. They may have a copper-green lead-based enamel painted over dry black cobalt ground on the biscuit, and a transparent green glaze was then applied, giving it a near-iridescent appearance. Famille noire was once highly appreciated by western collectors, which led to high prices and many pieces were then counterfeited, with the result that a large proportion of those believed to be surviving examples are actually forgeries. The popularity of this type of porcelain has since declined. \\n\\n\\n== Famille rose ==\\n\\n \\nFamille rose, known in Chinese as fencai (粉彩) or ruancai (軟彩 / 软彩), lit. \\'pale colours\\' or \\'soft colours\\'), yangcai (洋彩), lit. \\'foreign colours\\'), and falangcai (珐琅彩, lit. \\'enamel colours\\'), is a type of porcelain defined by the presence of pink colour overglaze enamel. The colour palette was introduced in China during the reign of Kangxi (1654–1722), possibly around 1720, but perfected only in the Yongzheng era when the finest pieces were made. Famille rose is named after its pink-coloured enamel, although it ranged from pale pink to deep ruby. Apart from pink, a range of other soft colour palettes were used in famille rose, hence the term fencai. The gradation of colours was produced by mixing coloured enamels with \\'glassy white\\' (玻璃白, boli bai), an opaque white enamel (lead arsenate).\\nIt is generally believed that the new colour palette in China was introduced by Jesuits in China (through the use of purple of Cassius) to the Imperial court, initially on enamels used on metal wares such as cloisonné produced in the falang workshop (珐琅作, falang meaning enamel may have originated from the word for the \"Franks\" or \"France\"), or through adaptation of enamels used in tin-glazed South German earthenware. Research has failed to show that the chemical composition of the pink colour pigment on famille rose to be the same as that of the European one. However, the term used by Tang Ying (who oversaw the production of porcelain at Jingdezhen) and in Qing documents was yangcai (\"foreign colours\"), indicating its foreign origin or influence.  Rudimentary famille rose have been found in Chinese porcelain from the 1720s, although the technique was not fully developed until around 1730 during the Yongzheng period. The pink of the early pieces of the 1720s were darker in colours made with ruby-coloured glass, but after 1725 softer shades were achieved by mixing with white enamels. At the Palace workshops in Beijing, experimentation was conducted to develop a range of enamel colours and techniques for applying the such enamels onto blank porcelain supplied by Jingdezhen, and the wares produced were called falangcai. Court painters were employed to make drafts to decorate such wares, which produced a new aesthetic style of decoration on porcelain. Falangcai decorations may be painted on a white ground, or on a coloured ground with yellow being the most popular. As falangcai  was produced at the palace for its exclusive use, there are relatively fewer pieces of falangcai porcelain.\\nWith the successful creation of falangcai porcelain at the palace, falangcai was also then made at the imperial kilns of Jingdezhen. The term yangcai was used to refer to porcelain produced at Jingdezhen to imitate falangcai. Visually there is little difference in appearance between falangcai and yangcai wares produced for imperial use, but differences may be detected in the chemical composition of the flux used. Ruancai (\\'soft colours\\') was also a term used in the Yongzheng era as the colours used are softer in contrast to the \\'hard colours\\' (硬彩, yingcai) previously used for famille verte or wucai. Fencai is the more modern term used by Chen Liu (陈浏) in the early 20th century and it then replaced yangcai in Chinese usage.\\nThe famille rose enamels allow for a greater range of colour and tone than was previously possible, enabling the depiction of more complex images, particularly during the Qianlong era, and decorations became more elaborate and crowded in the later Qianlong period. The images may be painted on coloured grounds, including yellow, blue, pink, coral red, light green, \\'cafe au lait\\' and brown.  Black ground or famille noire may also be used on famille rose ware, but they are not highly regarded. Many produced in the Qianlong period were on eggshell porcelain. Famille rose supplanted famille verte in popularity, and its production overtook blue and white porcelain in the mid-18th century. It remained popular throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and continued to be made in the 20th century. The quality of wares produced however declined after the Qianlong period.\\n\\nJingdezhen produced many famille rose pieces, and some of the finest pieces were made there. However, from the late 18th century onwards, many pieces were decorated in the port city of Canton to produce the Canton ware intended for export, using white porcelain from Jingdezhen. In contrast to the more refined \\'court-taste\\' porcelain, export wares particularly those from the 19th century tend to be highly and brightly decorated. The decorative patterns used in these export wares may be referred to as Rose Canton, Rose Mandarin and Rose Medallion.\\nFamille rose enamels were known to have been used in Europe before its usage became established in China, for example in Vienna porcelain made by the Du Paquier factory in 1725. Large number of famille rose porcelains were exported from China to the West, and many European factories such as Meissen, Chelsea and Chantilly copied the famille rose palette used in Chinese porcelain. Export of Chinese porcelain then declined due to competition from the European factories.\\n\\nEuropean pieces in the styles\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nExample of fencai enamal ware\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/China%2C_Jiangxi_province%2C_Jingdezhen_kilns%2C_Qing_dynasty_%281644-1912%29%2C_Kangxi_-_Dish_with_Bird_on_Peach_Branch_-_1964.213.2_-_Cleveland_Museum_of_Art.tif)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Delft_plate_faience_Famille_Rose_1760_1780.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Guangdong_Sheng_Bowuguan_2013.12.15_10-56-18.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Guimet_porcelana_china_31.JPG)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Imperial_bowl_famille_rose_Guimet_G5249.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Jingdezhen_soft_paste_porcelain_flower_holder_Famille_Rose_1736_1796_Qianlong_period.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/MET_14_40_417_O1_sf.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/MET_37_191_8_S4_sf_%28cropped%29.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/MET_61_200_49ab_O4_sf.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Moon_flasks._Famille_rose._Qing_1723-35._Sir_Percival_David_Collection%2C_British_Museum.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Percival_David_Collection_DSCF3220_15.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Plate%2C_China%2C_1840-1900%2C_Rose_medallion_pattern_porcelain_-_Portland_Museum_of_Art_-_Portland%2C_Maine_-_DSC04117.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Punchbowl%2C_unidentified_maker%2C_China%2C_c._1765%2C_porcelain_-_Albany_Institute_of_History_and_Art_-_DSC08001.JPG)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Qing_export_porcelain_with_European_figure_Famille_Rose_first_half_of_18th_century.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Saint_Cloud_soft_paste_porcelain_flower_holder_Famille_Rose_1730_1740.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Saint_Cloud_soft_porcelain_spitting_bowl_Famille_verte_1730_1740.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Shanghai_Museum_2006_17-60.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Wucai_plate_for_exportation_Kangxi_period_circa_1680.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Wucai_plate_for_exportation_Kangxi_period_circa_1680_bis.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Wusai_vase_Shunzi_period_circa_1650_1660.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/%E7%8F%90%E7%90%85%E5%BD%A9%E8%8A%8D%E8%8D%AF%E9%9B%89%E9%B8%A1%E5%9B%BE%E7%8E%89%E5%A3%B6%E6%98%A5%E7%93%B608467.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Merge-split-transwiki_default.svg)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'title': 'Qing handicrafts', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_handicrafts'}, page_content='Handicrafts (手工业 shougongye) produced during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) were objects designed and hand-made by craftsmen. They were heavily ornate, incorporating Tibetan, Middle Eastern, Indian, and European techniques. The design or decorative aspect of the craft was as important as the crafting technique itself and Qing artisans were particular about the materials they used, such as jade (yu), stones, and wood. In their designs artisans drew heavily from a number of motifs, both mythical and natural. Certain areas in China became well known for specific types of handicrafts; for example, Jingdezhen was known as the capital of porcelain. During the Qing era, Imperial Workshops built in Beijing brought together artisans and raw materials that were once only obtainable in disparate regions. This allowed for the combining of technologies and materials to produce new types of handicrafts. The tributary system also brought new sources for materials and artisans that were not from the production centers.\\nTo the state, crafts were an important part of the Qing dynasty\\'s economy and were regulated by the state. With the stronger presence of Western powers in the nineteenth century, handicrafts, especially porcelain, took on different characteristics depending on whether it was for domestic consumption and international export. Unlike the Ming, the proliferation of handicrafts in the Qing dynasty not only attests to the dynasty\\'s \"materialistic mandate\" and but also the value of craftsmanship. Studies of the technological advancement of handicrafts in the Qing dynasty show the early stages of Chinese industrialization.\\n\\n\\n== Materials ==\\n\\nA list of common materials that were used by artisans.\\n\\nJade (yu)\\nHardstone\\nBamboo\\nSilk\\nClay\\nLacquer\\nHardwood\\nIvory\\nMarble\\nGlass\\n\\n\\n== Types of handicrafts ==\\nHandicrafts in the Qing era are marked by their ornamentation, use of colors, and innovative production technologies. These aspects not only enhanced the quality of objects produced, but added to their value as luxury products as it was easier for artisans to incorporate more complex techniques in their work. The advancement of handicraft technology and the contact between specialized artisans at imperial workshops resulted in the possibility of combining multiple raw materials in a singular object, such as the hardwood being inlaid with enamelled porcelain. With the increase of trade networks and the tributary system, the centers of certain handicraft traditions shifted as raw materials such as hardwoods and ivory from Southeast Asia, marble from Yunnan, and jade from Burma were able to be imported from different locations. For example, Suzhou became the center of the production of carved lacquer, jade carving, metalwork, silks, and furniture by the 18th century, replacing than the various center located in the towns of western Zhejiang. Taste for handicrafts also differed between the court and the literati. For example, the imperial household preferred blue-and-white porcelain in the 18th century while the literati preferred archaistic bronzes or ceramic imitations of bronzes. Handicrafts from the imperial manufactory set the standard, but the commercial market had a larger output in comparison.\\n\\n\\n=== Porcelain ===\\n\\nFurther information: Chinese ceramics\\nPorcelain changed significantly throughout the Qing era itself, moving from transitional porcelain to monochrome porcelain, porcelain with painted scenes, and export porcelain. Jingdezhen was the capital of Chinese porcelain since the Ming dynasty but other sites of porcelain production included Dehua, known for their production of porcelain dolls in both the Ming and Qing eras. Other forms of pottery like Yixing clayware were also popular in the Qing era. Wares in the mid-18th century were named after superintendents due to their achievements in the improvement of quality of porcelain: \\'Lang ware\\' was named after Lang Tingji, \\'Nian ware\\' after Nian Xiyao, and \\'Tang ware\\' after Tang Ying.\\nPorcelain in the Qing dynasty features opaque overglaze colors, especially highlighted through the style of monochrome porcelain. Monochrome porcelain also highlights the importance of smoothness (run) found in Qing era decoration and handicrafts. Glazes, in fact, only became a major party of decorative art during the Qing dynasty after the Kangxi, Yongzhen, and Qianlong emperors came into contact with Jesuit missionary glassmakers. Qing (青) (not to be confused with the character for the Qing dynasty, 清), meaning green, blue-green, or blue, was one type of glaze that artisans strove to perfect through techniques such as firing lavender glaze and apple-green enamel-type glaze at high temperatures to produce a multitude of tints and hues. Glazes also allowed for patterning techniques such as the \"cracked-ice\" style that was first featured on porcelain from the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Techniques for ceramic production advanced as emperors dug up earlier productions of ceramics from the palace collection to serve as models. Moreover, contact with imported enamels from Europe encouraged the pursuit of an even more diverse palette of colors, including sepia enamel (grisaille).\\n\\n\\n=== Inkstone ===\\n\\nInkstone (also called ink-slab, ink palette, or even Mr. Clay Water) were essential writing instruments in early modern East Asia. In China, inkstones were used in the culture of wen (writing, literature, civility), as a collectible object and desired gift, and as a marker of status. They were made out of clay, lacquered wood, old bricks, fallen times, glass, or semi-precious stones but were most often made from specifically harvested stones found in quarries. During the Qing era, the Kangxi emperor insisted that inkstones were to be made out of a new material, Songhua stone, in hopes of grafting a Manchu identity on a Chinese instrument. Songhua stones, being slender, flat, and thin, often patterned with bright green or purple veins or layers, could be easily shaped and carved with innovative technology that allowed for a combination of materials and techniques. However, inkstones made from Duan and She stones remained the favorites of Chinese scholars and literati.\\nGu Erniang (fl. 1700-1722) was the most famous female stone-carver and one of the most accomplished among all stone-makers in the Qing era from Suzhou province. Accounts from her patrons in the Inkstone Chronicle compiled by Lin Fuyin (ca. 1690-1572) reveal the importance of both artisans and literati in the life of inkstones and vice versa. The mark of Gu also attests to her identity as a \"super-brand\" and the popularization of inkstones as collectible items, as it was during this era when marking handicrafts with signs of authorship became a common practice.\\n\\n\\n=== Furniture and wood carving ===\\n\\nMany Jiangnan cities became known for furniture and carved objects during the Qing era. Highly ornate and decorative furniture made from the best wood could only be found in the dwellings of the literati and court elite. In the 16th century, hardwood furniture from Jiangnan was on the rise. In contrast to lacquered soft-wood furniture, exposed wood became the norm and a luxury surface. Main types of hardwood include zitian (紫檀, rosewood or red sandalwood), hualimu (花梨木 rosewood), jichimu (鸡翅木 lit. chicken wing wood), tielimu (铁力木 ironwood), wumu (乌木 ebony), and hongmu (红木 mahogany) who all had their own distinctive color and grain. Softwoods like southern elm and namu burl were also popular, alongside spotted bamboo.\\nFurniture and wood carving in the Qing era owes much of taste to styles from previous dynasties. Root-wood is one popular style of furniture and incense stand that has proliferated since the Tang dynasty (618-907). It is made by separate pieces of wood being joined by pegs in order to emulate the form of a tree\\'s single root. Furthermore, Ming literati taste continued to influence furniture styles in Shanxi such that even 19th century furniture retained principles of Ming dynasty cabinetry.\\n\\n\\n=== Textiles ===\\nIn the early Qing era, there were about 800 textile looms in Suzhou, but by the reign of the Qianlong emperor and the Jiaqing emperor, there were as many as 30,000 looms in Nanjing, 10,000 in Suzhou, and 3,000 in Hanzhou. Southern China was known for its innovation of dress and fashion due to the strong silk industry in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. Textiles were used to accent plain furniture with bright colors, but they were also used as tributary items due to the high value of silk. Textile artisans and embroiderers used the technique trompe l\\'œil to create the illusion of a painting mounted on a scroll but the technique also became adapted in large-scale building projects.\\nKesi (cut silk) silk tapestry is one type of textile that was first used in the Tang dynasty, but continued to proliferate until the end of the Qing. The technique of cutting silk can also be used to replicate famous paintings and paintings of literati but mostly featured symmetrically composed designs. Kesi was mostly used for table and chair coverings during formal occasions but their patterning also became imbued in other forms of surfaces, such as lacquer, jade, and bamboo carving. Kesi silk tapestry were among the many art forms catalogued during the Qianlong emperor\\'s reign (producing the Bidian Zhulin and the Shiqu Baoji, published in 1744–1745, 1793, and 1816), alongside painting and calligraphy.\\n\\n\\n== Motifs ==\\n\\nHandicrafts during the Qing era were more elaborate in terms of its decoration and shapes, especially prominent in crafts produced for the imperial family or ceremonial purposes. Handicrafts also became the surfaces where stories were told or where literati artists displayed their technique. They also become important objects for use, display, and collection. There were crafts that presented more than one of these motifs outlined below but not all surfaces were inlaid with motifs either. \\n\\nMythical motifs: dragons (long) were a popular symbol used in handicrafts and Qing art in general. Under Kangxi rule, its identity as a shape-shifting creature signifies the inheritance of the Chinese imperial tradition that was significant during an era where the dynasty\\'s identity as \"foreign\" rule had to be legitimated. Hanjun bannerman Liu Yuan (ca. 1641-before 1691) is one artisan who was well known for his use of dragons. Other mythical motifs include qilin, flying horses, and magic fish.\\nReligious motifs: lotus imagery was often used in reference to The Lotus Sutra, a central text of Mahayanist Buddhism. Daoist and Confucian symbols were also found among surfaces and sometimes found together. Ceremonies also required the use of handicrafts and homes were often turned into religious spaces during festivals, marriages, deaths, and ancestor worship. During this time, Buddhist statues continued to be produced, especially when the Qing state made alliances with Tibet and Mongolia.\\nNatural motifs: natural motifs demonstrate the way man-made environment was connected to the natural environment and thus nature was a heavy point of reference in both Ming and Qing handicrafts. As countrysides rapidly urbanized, nature became increasingly important, even if it was represented artificially through handicrafts. In contrast to religious motifs, secular motifs could evoke prosperity, happiness, fertility and more. For example, fish (yu) were used to symbolize abundance and plenty. Items like pine, bamboo, and prunus were depicted together as the \"three friends of the coldest part of the year.\"\\nArchaic motifs: the style of archaic bronzes produced during the Tang dynasty was a popular form of vessel in the Qing period, so much so that replicas and forgeries were made. Patterns and vessel shapes from even earlier Chinese history were also valued. Patination was used as a technique to simulate the aged look of bronzes and archaic vessels. Archaic objects projected a sense of antiquity and political authority in connecting art forms to Chinese art traditions of the past. Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci wrote that to the Chinese archaic bronze collector, \"they desire them with a certain particular corrosion.\"\\nWomen as motifs: the beautiful young woman (美人 meiren) was a common motif in decorative handicrafts for she symbolized the pleasure of viewing the object and real-life women as well. Women in white make-up was also a comparison for the measure of whiteness on the surfaces of vases and handicrafts and often depicted with white porcelain bowls or white jade vases. The blackness of women\\'s hair was evoked in the comparison to lacquer.\\n\\n\\n== Imperial workshops ==\\nImperial workshops, or Palace Workshops, (造辦處 zaobanchu) were first established during the Kangxi emperor\\'s reign in 1680 around the Forbidden City and Yuanmingyuan palace. Imperial workshops was one place where technocratic culture was formed. They were established for the maintenance and creation of objects for the imperial family or ceremonial functions of the court but they also thrived as an area of artistic production as artisans and craftsmen from all over China, Asia, and even overseas (Jesuits from Europe) came into contact with each other. In addition, official workshops were established in certain provinces and the court continued to send out orders to those workshops, making certain areas well known for their production of a single type of handicraft. The first forty years of the imperial workshop system is unknown due to a lack of archives, but some aspects can be constructed from material evidence of the objects that were produced. Under the reign of the Yongzheng emperor (1723-1735), imperial workshops became better rationalized and organized as different offices were established to maximize operational capacity.\\nImperial workshops, being in close proximity to the imperial seat, boasted an \"imperial\" style that was meant to differentiate between objects produced in the imperial quarters and those outside the court. In fact, all objects also had to be made and released with the emperor\\'s approval. As a result, handicrafts produced during different reigns varied in style because the emperors had their own \"imperial style\". For example, the Yongzheng emperor favored West Hill stones for inkstones and preferred details like a contrast of colors between the inkstone\\'s box and stone.\\n\\n\\n== Handicraft regulations ==\\nZeli (則例) or \"regulations and precedents\" were legal documents produced by the Qing court for administrative units. Jiangzuo zeli (匠作則例) or \"handicraft regulations\" were sets of texts and lists produced by officials that set the precedent for the production of buildings and handicrafts as determined by the imperial standard. They include administrative references, account books, and cost estimates. Before building products and luxury production, cost estimates, a list of materials and workloads, and technical data had to be submitted to the Ministry of Public Works and these were record in the jiangzuo zeli.\\nThe handicraft regulations are not only a valuable source to the technical history of handicrafts in Qing China but demonstrate the regulation of economy and wages. In contemporary China, architects and historians use these documents to analyze and rebuild historical buildings for the preservation of Chinese cultural heritage.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nPorcelain trade in Qing China\\nQing art\\nChinese textiles\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nA Handbook of Chinese Ceramics from The Metropolitan Museum of Art\\nNeedham, Joseph.

Dmitry Ivanovich Vinogradov, a talented mining engineer who studied metallurgy at Freiberg, Saxony, developed the formula for the first porcelain manufactory in Russia, established in 1744 by order of Empress Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great, to \"serve native trade and native art.\"\\nFor a long time, the factory produced wares almost exclusively for the ruling Romanov family and the Russian imperial court, and for political and diplomatic gifts by them.  Dinner services, often very large, were a staple, and from the 1780s, figures of Russian peasants and ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire taken from book illustrations. These last continued until the Revolution, and largely replaced the repertoire of pastoral, gallant, and commedia dell\\'arte figures familiar from factories in the rest of Europe.  From the arrival of Neoclassical styles, the factory became known for large and ornate vases with painted scenes.\\nThe Russian porcelain by Vinogradov had qualities similar to Meissen porcelain, while its formula (which consisted of only Russian ingredients) took its style from Chinese porcelain. At the beginning of the Vinogradov period, the motifs were monochrome and simplified; by the end of this period, developed miniatures were completed on porcelain. Gold leaf for gilding porcelain was prepared from golden coins from the Imperial Treasury.\\n‘The Golden Age of Catherine’ – the reign of Catherine the Great – was the age of  prosperity for the fine Russian porcelain. In 1765, the manufactory was renamed the Imperial Porcelain Manufactory (IPM). From the very beginning of Catherine\\'s reign, IPM was obliged to produce porcelain and also to bring profit. The Imperial Court\\'s need for porcelain was large, and the permanent orders from the Court let IPM maintain the highest quality.\\nDuring the reign of Paul I (1796 to 1801), Russian porcelain continued to develop in style of Neoclassicism, with the increasing influence of Hellenic and Roman motifs.\\n\\n\\n=== 1801–1825 ===\\n\\nMasters from the Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin and porcelain painters from the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres were invited to Saint Petersburg, and the kiln chamber was restructured. In 1806, with the imposition of Napoleon\\'s Continental Blockade, the import of porcelain to Russia was banned and competition between a variety of Russian private porcelain factories arose. The production line of IPM porcelain was divided into a department for producing expensive low-profit Royal presents and a department producing ordinary porcelain for consumers among the Russian nobility.\\n\\n\\n=== 1825–1894 ===\\nFrom the reign of Nicholas I (1825 to 1855), imported kaolin from Limoges began to be used. Porcelain plaques and large porcelain items of high perfection were made. A special method of durable fire gilding that could be burnished was invented, although subsequently lost.\\nNicholas I took a personal part in the managing of IPM. The projects for porcelain items were handed in to him for his confirmation. The manufactory\\'s own museum was established in 1844. Later on, a library was formed from  books on art, paintings and engravings.\\nBy the beginning of the reign of Alexander II (1855 to 1881), IPM worked only with imported raw materials. A year before the abolition of serfdom, the IPM workers had been given their freedom, but many of them continued to work at IPM. However, the number of the Imperial Court\\'s orders decreased. The porcelain was produced mainly on old models. From the beginning of the 1870s, copying of famous paintings on porcelain ceased, and landscapes were rarely painted. Instead, purely ornamental decoration prevailed. IPM started to use coloured glazes and to decorate their porcelain with pâte-sur-pâte patterns.\\nThe idea of closing down the ‘useless and unprofitable’ enterprise emerged in 1881. Later on, the idea transformed into the assignation of IPM to the Imperial Academy of Arts, but Alexander III, whose reign had just started, commanded the best possible conditions (from a technological and arts point of view) for IPM so that IPM could bear its name \"Imperial\" with dignity and set a standard for all private porcelain manufactory owners.\\nIn 1889, the new formula was invented for the dark red sang-de-boeuf glaze. Since 1892, the underglaze decoration technology had been mastered with the help of Danish experts. The Russian emperor was married to a Danish princess and paid interest to the underglaze painting.\\n\\n\\n=== 1894–1917 ===\\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, IPM had become one of the leading porcelain factories in Europe. IPM porcelain was famous for its exceptional quality. It was produced from body made of the highest quality ingredients on up-to-date equipment. This body was stored in cellars for 10 years before use in production.\\nThe Art Nouveau style influenced the shapes of the porcelain. Porcelain was produced with whimsically curved forms decorated by stylized plants, mermaids and other Art Nouveau motifs. As a rule, the vases were covered by underglaze decor. Every vase had a unique form. The underglaze decoration made it possible for the artists to paint changeable seasons and winter landscapes.\\nIPM began to produce technical and chemical porcelain due to the end of imports of porcelain from Germany during World War I. The production of fine porcelain was decreased to a minimal level. All the fine porcelain items produced were sold at charity auctions benefitting the imperial hospitals. Only Easter eggs were produced in large quantities for Easter celebrations of soldiers.\\n\\n\\n=== Soviet period ===\\n\\nWith the abolition of the Russian monarchy in 1917, the Imperial Porcelain Factory was renamed \"State Porcelain Factory\" (GFZ - Gossudarstvennyi Farforovyi Zavod) by the Bolshevik regime.  During the early years of the Soviet Union, the GFZ produced so-called propaganda wares, ranging from plates to figurines of the Soviet elite.\\nIn 1925, on the occasion of the 200th jubilee of the Russian Academy of Sciences, it was given the name of the academy\\'s founder, Mikhail Lomonosov. It became known as the Leningrad Lomonosov Porcelain Factory (LFZ - Leningradski Farforovyi Zavod imeni M.V. Lomonosova).  The newly christened Lomonosov factory produced a range of wares, including collectible animal figurines and dinner sets.\\nIts best-known pattern, cobalt net, first appeared in 1949.  The design is based on a blue net pattern that was painted on raised lines cast into the porcelain dinnerware pieces of Catherine the Great.  The factory has actual examples of Catherine\\'s dinnerware with this design.  The new design pattern is a combination of intersecting lines of cobalt blue with inverted tear drops of cobalt blue (made from mineral cobalt) and 22 karat gold accents. There is also a version that artist Anna Yatskevich, the author of the famous cobalt net, painted a set in memory of the cross-glued windows of houses and the cross-light of searchlights that illuminated the sky of besieged Leningrad. These crosses on the windows were used as a device reducing small vibrations because of strong blast wave.\\n\\n\\n=== Post-Soviet era ===\\nLFZ was privatized in 1993 as the \"Lomonosov Porcelain Factory\".  At that time, wide exports began to countries unfamiliar with Lomonosov wares, particularly the United States and Japan. KKR and The U.S. Russia Investment Fund owned 51% until 1999, when the Russian government nationalized the company. In 2002, LFZ was sold to Nikolai Tsvetkov, President of Nikoil.\\n\\n\\n== Return to old name ==\\nOn 29 May 2005, the stockholders of Lomonosov Porcelain Factory passed a resolution to return to their pre-Soviet name, the Imperial Porcelain Manufactory.\\nThe IPM has recently started to produce hand-made copies of porcelain from the range of Imperial porcelain exhibited in the State Hermitage Museum collection. This range includes dinner sets, collectable plates, vases,  figurines  from the famous series of the Russian Peoples and other porcelain items from the assortment of porcelain made here since the foundation of the manufactory in 1744.\\n\\n\\n== Post-Soviet backstamps ==\\nThe first post-Soviet export backstamp was a red LFZ monogram, with \"Made in Russia\" stamped in red.  After 2002, a new export backstamp appeared which featured a red or blue LFZ monogram along with the words \"Hand Decorated, 1744, St. Petersburg, Russia\".  The post-2005 pieces are stamped \"Imperial Porcelain, 1744, St. Petersburg\", along with the double-headed imperial eagle.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nPorcelain manufacturing companies in Europe\\nFine Art of Leningrad\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\"Russian Imperial Manufactory 1744-1904\" Baron Von Wolf\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website\\nImperial Porcelain Factory collection at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Beaker_and_saucer_MET_ES6528.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Cup_with_cover_%28from_a_tea_service%29_MET_ES6561.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Cup_with_cover_and_saucer_MET_ES4585.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Elizabeth%27s_rococo_porcelain_04_%28Russia%2C_1750-60s%29.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Female_Shaman_MET_ES6532.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Fisherman_MET_ES6534.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Ice_Cream_Seller_MET_ES6536.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Kuskovo_Palace_Dining_Room.JPG)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/LFZ_chinaware_3.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Lapplander_MET_ES6544.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Lesser_coat_of_arms_of_the_Russian_Empire.svg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Old_Petersburg_exposition_07.JPG)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Tankard_MET_ES6559.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Theeservies_met_landschappen%2C_BK-1960-24.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Vases_01.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2._%D0%A7%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B0._1749.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/Imperial_Porcelian_Factory_logo.png)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6d/Newifzlogo.png)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/Newlomologo_blue.jpg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg)\\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'title': 'Jingdezhen porcelain', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingdezhen_porcelain'}, page_content='Jingdezhen porcelain (Chinese: 景德镇陶瓷) is Chinese porcelain produced in or near Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province in southern China. Jingdezhen may have produced pottery as early as the sixth century CE, though it is named after the reign name of Emperor Zhenzong, in whose reign it became a major kiln site, around 1004. By the 14th century it had become the largest centre of production of Chinese porcelain, which it has remained, increasing its dominance in subsequent centuries.  From the Ming period onwards, official kilns in Jingdezhen were controlled by the emperor, making imperial porcelain in large quantity for the court and the emperor to give as gifts.\\nAlthough apparently an unpromising location for potteries, being a remote town in a hilly region, Jingdezhen is close to the best quality deposits of petuntse, more contemporarily called pottery stone in China, as well as being surrounded by forests, mostly of pine, providing wood for the kilns. It also has a river leading to river systems flowing north and south, facilitating transport of fragile wares. The imperial kilns were in the centre of the city at Zhushan (Pearl Hill), with many other kilns four kilometres away at Hutian.\\nIt has produced a great variety of pottery and porcelain, for the Chinese market and as Chinese export porcelain, but its best-known high quality porcelain wares have been successively Qingbai ware in the Song and Yuan dynasties, blue and white porcelain from the 1330s, and the \"famille rose\" and other \"famille\" colours under the Qing dynasty.\\n\\n\\n== Official kilns ==\\nThe Mongol Yuan dynasty established a body, the \"Fuliang Porcelain Bureau\" to regulate production, and the next Ming dynasty established official kilns to produce porcelain for the emperor; Jingdezhen continued to produce Imperial porcelain until the end of Imperial rule.  The imperial kilns were situated at Pearl Hill (Zhushan) in Jingdezhen; some scholars give a date of 1369 for the commencement of production. But there continued to be many other kilns, producing wares for many distinct markets.\\nThe imperial court, except during periods of crisis, generated a huge demand for porcelain. Apart from the vast main palaces and other residences, for much of the period the many princes had subsidiary regional courts. There were imperial temples to be supplied, each of which was given monochrome wares in different colours, as well as several monasteries and shrines.  The porcelain to which different ranks of the imperial household were entitled were set out in minute detail in regulations. The final version of these, from 1899, specified that the Empress Dowager Cixi was allowed 821 pieces of yellow porcelain, while the Empress had 1,014. A concubine of the first rank had 121 pieces of yellow with a white interior, but those of the second rank had yellow decorated with green dragons.\\n\\n\\n=== Ming ===\\n\\nThe Ming dynasty is normally dated as beginning in 1368, but there was a long revolt against the Yuan dynasty, and Jingdezhen was lost by them in 1352.  By 1402 there were twelve imperial kilns at Jingdezhen, then one of three areas with imperial kilns. Production was controlled by a ministry in the capital, by then in Beijing, far to the north.  Production was on a huge scale, employing hundreds if not thousands of workers, whose tasks were divided into several specialities to increase efficiency and consistency. In 1433 a single order from the palace was for 443,500 pieces of porcelain, all with dragon and phoenix designs.  Court artists were by now supplying drawn or woodblock printed designs from the capital.  These enormous quantities were distributed by the palace to the subsidiary courts of the many Ming princes sent to govern provinces, as well as being presented as gifts to other notables, and sent abroad as diplomatic gifts.  Some may also have been sold, especially for export.  Sometimes antique pieces in the Imperial collection were sent to Jingdezhen to be copied.\\nA recently excavated Ming princely burial has yielded the first example to survive until modern times of a type of gaiwan set known from 15th-century paintings.  There is a blue and white Jingdezhen stem cup, that has a silver stand and a gold cover (this dated 1437), all decorated with dragons.  Presumably many such sets existed, but recycling the precious metal elements was too tempting at some point, leaving only the porcelain cups.  Other imperial porcelains may have carried gilding, which has now worn away.\\nUnder the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–24), reign marks were introduced for the first time, applied to porcelain and other types of luxury products made for the imperial court.  The supremacy of Jingdezhen was reinforced in the mid-15th century when the imperial kilns producing Longquan celadon, for centuries one of China\\'s finest wares, were closed after celadons fell from fashion.  Apart from the much smaller production of monochrome stoneware \"official Jun\" wares from Henan, used in the palace for flowerpots and the like, Jingdezhen was now the only area making imperial ceramics.\\n\\nA wide variety of wares were produced for the court, with blue and white (initially ignored by the court but acceptable by 1402) accompanied by red and white wares using a copper-based underglaze red. This was sometimes combined with the cobalt blue in blue and red pieces.  Under the Xuande Emperor (r. 1426–1435) a copper-red monochrome glaze was used for ceremonial wares, of which very few survive. These ceased to be produced after his death, and have never been perfectly imitated, despite later attempts. This suggests the close personal interest some emperors took in the imperial potteries, and also that some secrets must have been restricted to a small group of potters. The Ru ware of the Song dynasty had a similar pattern.  In this reign enamel or overglaze decoration was developed, which was to dominate the finer wares in future centuries.\\nIn the late Ming period, the reigns of the five emperors from 1488 to 1620, there was little innovation in styles of decoration, though some alterations in the colours used.  In this period the enormous quantities of porcelain made in China seem to have led to low prices and a loss of prestige, at court and in Chinese society in general. Those who could afford to do so still ate from gold, silver or jade; it was in the Islamic world, where the Quran forbad tableware in precious metal, that rulers ate from Chinese porcelain.  One disgraced official, whose goods were seized in 1562, had his valuable items confiscated, but not his collection of 45,000 pieces of porcelain, which were sold with his other effects.  By the reign of the Wanli Emperor (r. 1573–1620) there was a serious decline in quality.\\nHowever the same period saw the spread of porcelain collecting among the scholar-gentry, who were mostly interested in older pieces, though generally not going further back than the Song. This is not the first period of antiquarianism and archaism in Chinese taste, but it has proved long-lasting, and had a considerable effect on subsequent production, producing waves of revivalism, imitation and much downright fakery—the three often being hard to distinguish.\\n\\n\\n=== Transitional wares ===\\n\\nAs the Ming dynasty declined, with serious military and financial crises, the imperial court ceased to support the official Jingdezhen kilns, which were largely left to find their own funds from other markets. This situation lasted from 1620 to 1683, when the new Qing dynasty, after some decades struggling with Ming forces, finally resumed large-scale use of Jingdezhen for official wares under the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722). The larger kilns and a major part of the town were destroyed in 1674 by Ming forces after the Revolt of the Three Feudatories had become a civil war. From 1680 to 1688 the reconstruction of the industry was under the control of Zang Yingxuan from the Qing Board of Works. Organised production of court porcelain had resumed by 1683, and the institution of forced labour replaced by waged employment. Succeeding controllers were appointed by the provincial administration up until 1726, when Beijing appointed Nian Xiyao.\\nWares of this interim period are often called \"Transitional\", and include the Tianqi porcelain mostly made for the Japanese market.  The effect on the Jingdezhen potters was \"liberating\", as the range of subject matter in decoration greatly expanded.  Printed books had become much more widely available, and were used, directly or indirectly, as sources for scenes on porcelain.  Conveniently for the historian, many pieces began to be dated. Towards the end of the period the first famille rose porcelains appeared; the various colour \"families\" were to dominate production for the luxury market under the Qing.\\n\\n\\n=== Qing ===\\n\\nThe imperial kilns were revived with 6 kilns and 23 workshops, dividing the other parts of the production process between them. Massive orders for the imperial palaces and temples resumed.  While imperial taste in decoration remained somewhat conservative, the technical quality of Kangxi imperial wares reached new heights.  The imperial kilns led the development of the new palettes of overglaze enamels; famille verte, developed in two phases, was followed by famille rose, and later others.  There was also development of subtle, varied and mottled glazes for monochrome pieces. Sang de boeuf glaze was a copper oxide red, as was peachbloom glaze, which was probably blown onto the piece as powder.  These were the last major technical innovations at Jingdezhen, along with a technique for firing gold onto porcelain, rather than mercury gilding completed pieces.\\nThe long reign of the Qianlong emperor (1736–1795) saw continuation of the technical perfection, but aesthetic stagnation. The emperor was a keen art collector and probably personally directed the trends in this period for imitating shapes from ancient metalware, especially ritual bronzes, in porcelain, as well as imitations of wood and other materials.  The copying of famous wares from the distant past continued, alongside new styles. In the next two reigns the quality also declined, and orders from the palace were reduced, until the official kilns were destroyed in the Taiping Rebellion in the 1850s. Tongzhi porcelain from 1862 to 1874 dates from after the reconstruction of the Jingdezhen official kilns.\\n\\n\\n== Major types ==\\n\\n\\n=== Jingdezhen bluish-white ware ===\\n\\nJingdezhen ware became particularly important from the Song period with the production of Qingbai (青白, \"Blueish-white\") ware. The Jingdezhen Qingbai was a transparent and jade-like type of porcelain, with a transparent glaze giving a blueish-white tint. Decoration was made by delicate carving or incising. Northern Ding ware was the most famous northern Chinese white ware under the Northern Song, but by the end of the Song period Qingbai had eclipsed Ding ware, achieving a predominance for Jingdezhen which it has maintained in subsequent centuries.  A key event in this process was the flight of the remaining Northern Song court to the south, after they lost control of the north in the disastrous Jin-Song wars of the 1120s. A new Southern Song court was based in Hangzhou.   This may have been accompanied by the movement of potters to Jingdezhen, which increased its output, despite being some two hundred miles from the new capital.\\nA Qingbai porcelain bottle from Jingdezhen is the earliest piece of Chinese porcelain documented to have reached Europe; this is the Fonthill Vase, which was brought to Europe in the middle of the 14th century.\\nUnder the Yuan dynasty, Jingdezhen\\'s finest whitewares changed to Shufu ware, named after the two character inscription on some pieces. Shufu may mean the pieces were ordered for the Shumiyuan (\"Privy Council\"); despite this, most examples have appeared outside China. The Shufu pieces are thick, with an opaque white glaze, with a faint blue-green tint.  The stem cup shape first appears in these; it lasted until the end of the Ming.\\n\\n\\n=== Jingdezhen blue-and-white porcelain ===\\n\\nFrom the mid-14th century, Jingdezhen began to mass-produce underglaze blue porcelain, whose development it pioneered, making it \"one of the world\\'s earliest industrial towns\".  Much of this was for export, and other styles were produced for the Chinese market. Elaborately-painted wares were not in the traditional court taste, but they evidently came to be accepted.  The large round serving-plates, from 40 cm across, which are now among the most valued pieces, reflect the needs of Middle Eastern rather than Chinese food service, which generally uses large numbers of smaller and deeper bowls, then as now. Wares for export also often had thicker bodies, to reduce breakages on long travels to the export markets. In early periods, the markets receiving porcelain direct from China included Japan, all of South-East Asia, and much of the Islamic world, but did not include Europe on a regular basis.  Until the 17th century, Europe normally only received porcelain via the Islamic world.\\nThe blue pigment was derived from cobalt oxide, which had been imported sporadically from Persia in earlier periods. From the 14th century regular imports of the pigment were obtained from Persia. The cobalt was ground and mixed with a medium, then painted onto the dried bodies of the pots, which were then glazed and fired. At a later date a source of cobalt was found within China; this differed from the Persian ore in the proportion of associated manganese. The colour on the fired pots was a grey-blue rather than a pure blue. By mixing three parts Persian ore to two parts Chinese a rich and soft blue was produced, which became labelled as \\'Sumatran\\' or \\'Muhammadan\\' blue.\\nOne of the largest intact early collections of exported Chinese porcelain was at the Ardabil Shrine, and is now in the National Museum of Iran. This has 805 pieces of porcelain, donated by Shah Abbas I in 1607–1608, from the Persian royal collection.  Most were made in Jingdezhen, and they covered the full period of blue and white wares to that point, with some nearly 300 years old when donated.  The largely intact Ottoman collection is mostly in Topkapi Palace.\\nThe restriction of painted subjects to the combination of abstract geometrical patterns, plant-forms, and animals had begun to end during the first half of the 15th century, as human figures, landscape scenes and other subjects began to appear.  In the best wares, these designs were supplied by court artists and reflected contemporary painting and other media.  This trend continued in Transitional porcelain, produced for a period up to 1683 at the end of the Ming dynasty, and the later blue and white wares of the Kangxi reign are the final phase in the artistic development of blue and white, with superb technical quality in the best objects, and larger images, flexibly treated, on a wide variety of subjects.\\nTianqi porcelain is a type of relatively informal ware, largely destined for the Japanese market, made at Jingdezhen in the 17th century. Kraak ware is a type of Jingdezhen export porcelain produced mainly during the Wanli reign (1573–1620), but also in the remaining two Ming reigns. It was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Strictly defined, it \"is distinguished by the arrangement of its ornament into panels; these usually radiate to a bracketed rim notorious for its liability to chip\".  It was mostly made as \"deep bowls and wide dishes\", decorated with motifs from nature, in a style not used on wares for the domestic Chinese market.\\n\\n\\n== Organization during the Qing period ==\\n\\nDuring the Qing period production became more varied, with a wide spread of styles and qualities, from imperial wares, through those for export, to those for a popular domestic market. The dozens of non-imperial kilns are known as \"private\", with a few \"official old kilns\" making very high-quality wares for the Chinese nobility, which were \"often as fine in quality as the imperial pieces and had the added attraction of more adventurous decoration since court styles were prescribed and rather formal\"; at times these may have helped the imperial kilns with large orders.  The rest supplied various levels of the Chinese domestic and export markets. Early in the period the original local source of clay ran out, and new diggings were begun.\\nThe French Jesuit François Xavier d\\'Entrecolles visited Jingdezhen and wrote to Europe about its processes between 1712 and 1721; he also gave the Chinese useful information about European pigments. From this period Europe began its own porcelain industry, which grew rapidly, initially by imitating Chinese styles, and later by developing their own styles. Persia, Vietnam, Japan and several countries in South-East Asia had long been imitating Jingdezhen ware.  Towards the end of the century, exports to Europe were in decline, replaced by local wares.\\nIn 1726 Nian Xiyao was appointed by the Beijing court as controller at Jingdezhen, the first centrally-appointed official since 1680. He was also appointed controller for a customs barrier 400 miles to the north at Huai\\'an on the Grand Canal, which resulted in Nian only being able to visit Jingdezhen once a year. In 1728 a member of the imperial household staff, Tang Ying, was appointed resident assistant at Jingdezhen. Tang replaced Nian in 1735 when the latter was accused of corruption, and he became one of the most influential of the superintendents.\\nIn 1739 the customs office was moved to Jiujiang 90 miles west of Jingdezhen; Tang continued in the dual post until recalled to Beijing in 1743 by the Qianlong emperor. At court he was assigned the task of annotating twenty illustrations of the porcelain industry from the imperial library. Returning to Jingdezhen he stayed there, except for a brief period between 1750 and 1752, until his death at 75 years old in 1756.\\nWares bearing Tang Ying\\'s name survive; these include two pairs of blue-and-white candlesticks bearing dates of 1740 and 1741, the latter of which bears an inscription describing him as \"Controller of Pottery in Jiangxi\" amongst other official titles. Tang also wrote a number of books including A Complete Record of Pots (1735), Mental Notes of a Pottery Worker (1738) and Illustrated Explanation of the Miracles of the God of the Furnace (1747). His list of wares manufactured for the court runs to sixty types, some of which were recreations of styles of earlier periods.\\nFrom the late 18th century, much of Jingdezhen\\'s production was Canton porcelain, using \"blanks\" made, glazed, and fired at Jingdezhen but then taken to be decorated with enamels in Guangzhou (then usually romanized as Canton) for export to the west via the Thirteen Factories of the Canton System.\\nIn 1905 a European visitor reported that most production was in a short summer season, when workers from surrounding areas came to live in \"barrack-like sheds\" in the city, without their families. This influx took the population of the city to about 400,000, and caused some social problems.\\n\\n\\n== Exports to Europe ==\\n  \\n\\nEuropean visitors to Istanbul in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are recorded as having purchased Chinese porcelain there. Some other pieces came via the Portuguese settlement of Malacca; King Manuel I had several acquired from Vasco de Gama. The Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle contains the collection of  Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria, assembled during the mid-15th century. These early collections, typically of blue-and-white ware, were regarded as rare curios and art objects, and were often mounted in precious metals.\\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a number of European companies were established to import various commodities including tea, silk, spices, lacquerwork and porcelain from East Asia. Research by Volker has given figures for the trade in Chinese and Japanese porcelain carried out by the Dutch East India Company; between 1602 and 1682 the company exported between 30 and 35 million pieces. The English East India Company also imported around 30 million pieces, the French East India Company 12 million, the Portuguese East India Company 10 million and the Swedish East India Company some 20 million pieces between 1766 and 1786.\\nThe massive increase in imports allowed purchasers to amass large collections, which were often displayed in dedicated rooms or purpose-built structures. The Trianon de Porcellaine built between 1670 and 1672 was a Baroque pavilion constructed to display Louis XIV\\'s collection of blue-and-white porcelain, set against French blue-and-white faience tiles both on the interior and exterior of the building. It was demolished in 1687.\\n\\n\\n== After the empire ==\\n\\nFollowing the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 manufacture of porcelain for the imperial household ceased. In 1916 Yuan Shikai, acting as the Hongxian Emperor, appointed Guo Baochang to re-establish the imperial depot at Jingdezhen. Guo\\'s workforce were initially set to produce copies of Ru ware, but this approach was abandoned in favour of copying enamelled ware of the 18th century. The high-quality porcelain of the Hongxian establishment continued to be produced after the abandonment of the empire and the death of Yuan in 1916; the depot was taken over by the Jiangxi Porcelain Company who retained one hundred of the workers. Production of enamelled and thin-walled \"eggshell\" ware continued through the 1920s and 1930s, with many pieces bearing Hongxian reign marks. By the 1930s the buildings that had housed the imperial supervisors were being used as army barracks.\\n\\nCeramics continue to be produced on a large scale in Jingdezhen, in a variety of styles, many reproducing those of the past in a variety of qualities, with Jingdezhen porcelain being shipped around the world.  One trend that has continued in the 20th century is the development of super-thin \"eggshell\" porcelain for vases.  About 300 million pieces of porcelain were being produced annually in the late 20th century.\\n\\n\\n== Development of kiln technology ==\\nThe dragon kiln was the traditional form of kiln used in southern China. Also known as a climbing kiln, this type in its final development consisted of a tunnel-like flue built up a slope from a main firebox. Along the sides of the kiln subsidiary entrances for side-stoking enabled the whole structure to be heated, and allowing the later dragon kilns to exceed 50 metres in length without any substantial drop in temperature. The draught created by the flow of hot air up the slope meant that the dragon kiln could be built without a chimney.\\nThis type of kiln was supplanted at Jingdezhen by a gourd-shaped kiln, with a large firing chamber at the front, connecting to a smaller chamber with a lower roof and a chimney. The gourd-shaped kiln could produce large quantities of porcelain, fired at very high temperatures. By blocking the kiln vents to restrict air flow to the fire a reducing atmosphere of hydrogen and carbon monoxide could be maintained, which was necessary for some glazes such as copper red.\\nThe gourd-shaped kiln was used throughout the fourteenth century; towards the end of the Ming period it was supplanted by the egg-shaped kiln or zhenyao kiln, shaped like half an egg on its side, with a firebox inside the kiln at the broad end and at the narrow end an arch communicating to a separate chimney. The chimney was built to a height of around 19 metres; the high chimney increased the draught through the kiln and thus reduced the timing of the firing cycle to around 36 hours.\\nWares were placed inside stacked saggars on a floor of quartz sand; as the saggars protected their contents from direct flame both fuel and air could be introduced directly to the interior through vents, allowing temperature regulation throughout the kiln. Peepholes were used to observe the colour of flame, which changes according to the conditions and temperature. The hottest part of the kiln next to the firebox was used for crackle glazes; following inwards high-fired green and red glazes in a reducing atmosphere, then uncoloured, blue-glazed, and decorated ware at a moderate temperature, followed at the back by glazes to be fired at a lower temperature and turquoise-glazed ware in an oxidising atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nCanby, Sheila R.

       " Document(metadata={'title': 'Japanese pottery and porcelain', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pottery_and_porcelain'}, page_content='Pottery and porcelain (陶磁器, tōjiki; also yakimono (焼きもの), or tōgei (陶芸)) is one of the oldest Japanese crafts and art forms, dating back to the Neolithic period. Types have included earthenware, pottery, stoneware, porcelain, and blue-and-white ware. Japan has an exceptionally long and successful history of ceramic production. Earthenwares were made as early as the Jōmon period (10,500–300 BC), giving Japan one of the oldest ceramic traditions in the world. Japan is further distinguished by the unusual esteem that ceramics hold within its artistic tradition, owing to the enduring popularity of the tea ceremony. During the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1573–1603), kilns throughout Japan produced ceramics with unconventional designs. In the early Edo period, the production of porcelain commenced in the Hizen-Arita region of Kyushu, employing techniques imported from Korea. These porcelain works became known as Imari wares, named after the port of Imari from which they were exported to various markets, including Europe.\\nJapanese ceramic history records the names of numerous distinguished ceramists, and some were artist-potters, e.g. Hon\\'ami Kōetsu, Ninsei, Ogata Kenzan, and Aoki Mokubei. Japanese anagama kilns also have flourished through the ages, and their influence weighs with that of the potters. Another important Japanese constituent of the art is the continuing popularity of unglazed high-fired stoneware even after porcelain became popular. Since the 4th century AD, Japanese ceramics have often been influenced by the artistic sensibilities of neighbouring East Asian civilizations such as Chinese and Korean-style pottery. Japanese ceramists and potters took inspiration from their East Asian artistic counterparts by transforming and translating the Chinese and Korean prototypes into a uniquely Japanese creation, with the resultant form being distinctly Japanese in character. Since the mid-17th century when Japan started to industrialize, high-quality standard wares produced in factories became popular exports to Europe. In the 20th century, a homegrown cottage ceramics industry began to take root and emerge. Major Japanese ceramic companies include Noritake and Toto Ltd.\\nJapanese pottery is distinguished by two polarized aesthetic traditions. On the one hand, there is a tradition of very simple and roughly finished pottery, mostly in earthenware and using a muted palette of earth colours. This relates to Zen Buddhism and many of the greatest masters were priests, especially in early periods. Many pieces are also related to the Japanese tea ceremony and embody the aesthetic principles of wabi-sabi. Most raku ware, where the final decoration is partly random, is in this tradition. The other tradition is of highly finished and brightly coloured factory wares, mostly in porcelain, with complex and balanced decoration, which develops Chinese porcelain styles in a distinct way. A third tradition, of simple but perfectly formed and glazed stonewares, also relates more closely to both Chinese and Korean traditions. In the 16th century, a number of styles of traditional utilitarian rustic wares then in production became admired for their simplicity, and their forms have often been kept in production to the present day for a collectors market.\\n\\n\\n== Ceramics types ==\\nThe types of ceramics can be divided into five groups: \\n\\nunglazed earthenware (素焼きの土器 \"Suyaki no doki\"): fired at high temperatures without any glaze, resulting in a natural, rustic appearance.\\nglazed earthenware (施和的器 seyūtōki or 低火度前 teikadoyū): fired at relatively low temperatures 800–900°C using lead as the medium, the technique was introduced from the Korean peninsula in the 7th century. Sansai (三彩) is another type of technique using lead glaze.\\nunglazed stoneware (焼き締め陶窓 yakishime tōki): fired at high temperatures without applying a coat of glaze. In the Middle Ages, it was used for living utensils such as vases, pots and other everyday items, and in the Azuchi-Momoyama period, it was modified for use in tea rooms due to its simple taste.\\nglazed stoneware (施和陶器 seyūtōki or 高火度和 kōkadoyū): fired at temperatures of 1250°C or higher. In many cases, the base is not pure white, but grey or brown in colour. It has a softer texture than porcelain and absorbs some water.\\nporcelain (磁器 jiki): a white colour with a high silica content and few impurities. Hard ware made by firing clay at high temperatures. The technique was introduced from the Korean peninsula at the beginning of the Edo period and production began in Arita, Hizen Province, Kyushu.\\n\\n\\n== Vessel types ==\\nSome of the typical vessel (器 utsuwa) types are: \\n\\ntea bowl (茶碗 chawan)\\njar (壷 tsuba)\\nbowl (鉢 hachi)\\ntea caddy (茶入 chaire)\\nThe various features of a vessel such as the opening, rim, neck, wall, inside, foot, surface markings, etc. all have standardised names in Japanese.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Jōmon period ===\\n\\nIn the Neolithic period (c.\\u200911th millennium BC), the earliest soft earthenware was made.\\nDuring the early Jōmon period in the 6th millennium BC typical coil-made ware appeared, decorated with hand-impressed rope patterns. Jōmon pottery developed a flamboyant style at its height and was simplified in the later Jōmon period. The pottery was formed by coiling clay ropes and fired in an open fire.\\n\\n\\n=== Yayoi period ===\\nIn about the 4th–3rd centuries BC Yayoi period, Yayoi pottery appeared which was another style of earthenware characterised by a simple pattern or no pattern. Jōmon, Yayoi, and later Haji ware shared the firing process but had different styles of design.\\n\\n\\n=== Kofun period ===\\n\\nIn the 3rd to 4th centuries AD, the anagama kiln, a roofed-tunnel kiln on a hillside, and the potter\\'s wheel appeared, brought to Kyushu island from the Korean peninsula.\\nThe anagama kiln could produce stoneware, Sue pottery, fired at high temperatures of over 1,200–1,300 °C (2,190–2,370 °F), sometimes embellished with accidents produced when introducing plant material to the kiln during the reduced-oxygen phase of firing. Its manufacture began in the 5th century and continued in outlying areas until the 14th century. Although several regional variations have been identified, Sue was remarkably homogeneous throughout Japan. The function of Sue pottery, however, changed over time: during the Kofun period (AD 300–710) it was primarily funerary ware; during the Nara period (710–94) and the Heian period (794–1185), it became an elite tableware; and finally it was used as a utilitarian ware and for the ritual vessels for Buddhist altars.\\nContemporary Haji ware and haniwa funerary objects were earthenware like Yayoi.\\n\\n\\n=== Heian period ===\\n\\nAlthough a three-color lead glaze technique was introduced to Japan from the Tang dynasty of China in the 8th century, official kilns produced only simple green lead glaze for temples in the Heian period, around 800–1200.\\nKamui ware appeared in this time, as well as Atsumi ware and Tokoname ware.\\n\\n\\n=== Kamakura period ===\\nUntil the 17th century, unglazed stoneware was popular for the heavy-duty daily requirements of a largely agrarian society; funerary jars, storage jars, and a variety of kitchen pots typify the bulk of the production. Some of the kilns improved their technology and are called the \"Six Old Kilns\": Shigaraki (Shigaraki ware), Tamba, Bizen, Tokoname, Echizen, and Seto.\\nAmong these, the Seto kiln in Owari Province (present day Aichi Prefecture) had a glaze technique. According to legend, Katō Shirozaemon Kagemasa (also known as Tōshirō) studied ceramic techniques in China and brought high-fired glazed ceramic to Seto in 1223. The Seto kiln primarily imitated Chinese ceramics as a substitute for the Chinese product. It developed various glazes: ash brown, iron black, feldspar white, and copper green. The wares were so widely used that Seto-mono (漢字・かな, \\'product of Seto\\') became the generic term for ceramics in Japan. Seto kiln also produced unglazed stoneware. In the late 16th century, many Seto potters fleeing the civil wars moved to Mino Province in the Gifu Prefecture, where they produced glazed pottery: Yellow Seto (Ki-Seto), Shino, Black Seto (Seto-Guro), and Oribe ware.\\n\\n\\n=== Muromachi period ===\\n\\nAccording to chronicles in 1406, the Yongle Emperor (1360–1424) of the Ming dynasty bestowed ten Jian ware bowls from the Song dynasty to the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358–1408), who ruled during the Muromachi period. A number of Japanese monks who traveled to monasteries in China also brought pieces back home. As they became valued for tea ceremonies, more pieces were imported from China where they became highly prized goods. Five of these vessels from the southern Song dynasty are so highly valued that they were included by the government in the list of National Treasures of Japan (crafts: others). Jian ware was later produced and further developed as tenmoku and was highly prized during tea ceremonies of this time.\\n\\n\\n=== Azuchi-Momoyama period ===\\nFrom the middle of the 11th century to the 16th century, Japan imported much Chinese celadon greenware, white porcelain, and blue-and-white ware. Japan also imported Chinese pottery as well as Korean and Vietnamese ceramics. Such Chinese ceramics (tenmoku) were regarded as sophisticated items, which the upper classes used in the tea ceremony. The Japanese also ordered custom-designed ceramics from Chinese kilns.\\nHighly priced imports also came from the Luzon and was called Rusun-yaki or \"Luzon ware\", as well as Annan from Annam, northern Vietnam.\\n\\n\\n=== Sengoku period ===\\n\\nWith the rise of Buddhism in the late 16th century, leading tea masters introduced a change of style and favored humble Korean tea bowls and domestic ware over sophisticated Chinese porcelain. The influential tea master Sen no Rikyū (1522–1591) turned to native Japanese styles of simple rustic pottery, often imperfect, which he admired for their \"rugged spontaneity\", a \"decisive shift\" of enormous importance for the development of Japanese pottery. The Raku family (named after the pottery rather than the other way round) supplied brown-glazed earthenware tea bowls. Mino, Bizen, Shigaraki (Shigaraki ware), Iga (similar to Shigaraki), and other domestic kilns also supplied tea utensils. The artist-potter Hon\\'ami Kōetsu made several tea bowls now considered masterpieces.\\nDuring Toyotomi Hideyoshi\\'s 1592 invasion of Korea, Japanese forces brought Korean potters as slaves to Japan, According to tradition, one of the kidnapped, Yi Sam-pyeong, discovered a source of porcelain clay near Arita and was able to produce the first Japanese porcelain. These potters also brought improved kiln technology in the noborigama or rising kiln, running up a hillside and enabling temperatures of 1,400 °C (2,550 °F) to be reached. Soon the Satsuma, Hagi, Karatsu, Takatori, Agano and Arita kilns were begun.\\n\\n\\n=== Edo period ===\\n\\nIn the 1640s, rebellions in China and wars between the Ming dynasty and the Manchus damaged many kilns, and in 1656–1684 the new Qing dynasty government stopped trade by closing its ports. Chinese potter refugees were able to introduce refined porcelain techniques and enamel glazes to the Arita kilns. From 1658, the Dutch East India Company looked to Japan for blue-and-white porcelain to sell in Europe (see Imari porcelain). At that time, the Arita kilns like the Kakiemon kiln could not yet supply enough quality porcelain to the Dutch East India Company, but they quickly expanded their capacity. From 1659 to 1740, the Arita kilns were able to export enormous quantities of porcelain to Europe and Asia. Gradually the Chinese kilns recovered, and developed their own styles of the highly coloured enamelled wares that Europeans found so attractive, including famille rose, famille verte and the rest of that group. From about 1720 Chinese and European kilns also began to imitate the Imari enamelled style at the lower end of the market, and by about 1740 the first period of Japanese export porcelain had all but ceased. The Arita kilns also supplied domestic utensils such as the so-called Ko-Kutani enamelware.\\nPorcelain was also exported to China, much of which was resold by Chinese merchants to the other European \"East Indies Companies\" which were not allowed to trade in Japan itself. It has been suggested that the choice of such items was mainly dictated by Chinese taste, which preferred Kakiemon to \"Imari\" wares, accounting for a conspicuous disparity in early European collections that can be reconstructed between Dutch ones and those of other countries, such as England, France and Germany. Because Imari was the shipping port, some porcelain, for both export and domestic use, was called Ko-Imari (old Imari). The European custom has generally been to call blue and white wares \"Arita\" and blue, red and gold ones \"Imari\", though in fact both were often made in the same kilns arong Arita. In 1759 the dark red enamel pigment known as bengara became industrially available, leading to a reddish revival of the orange 1720 Ko-Imari style.\\nIn 1675, the local Nabeshima family who ruled Arita established a personal kiln to make top-quality enamelware porcelain for the upper classes in Japan, which is called Nabeshima ware. This uses mainly decoration in traditional Japanese styles, often drawing from textiles, rather than the Chinese-derived styles of most Arita ware. Hirado ware was another kind of porcelain initially reserved for presentation as political gifts among the elite, concentrating on very fine painting in blue on an unusually fine white body, for which scroll painters were hired.  These two types represented the finest porcelain produced after the export trade stalled by the 1740s. Unlike Nabeshima ware, Hirado went on to be a significant exporter in the 19th century.\\nDuring the 17th century, in Kyoto, then Japan\\'s imperial capital, kilns produced only clear lead-glazed pottery that resembled the pottery of southern China. Among them, potter Nonomura Ninsei invented an opaque overglaze enamel and with temple patronage was able to refine many Japanese-style designs. His disciple Ogata Kenzan invented an idiosyncratic arts-and-crafts style and took Kyōyaki (Kyoto ceramics) to new heights. Their works were the models for later Kyōyaki. Although porcelain bodies were introduced to Kyōyaki by Okuda Eisen, overglazed pottery still flourished. Aoki Mokubei, Ninami Dōhachi (both disciples of Okuda Eisen) and Eiraku Hozen expanded the repertory of Kyōyaki.\\nIn the late 18th to early 19th century, white porcelain clay was discovered in other areas of Japan and was traded domestically, and potters were allowed to move more freely. Local lords and merchants established many new kilns (e.g., Kameyama kiln and Tobe kiln) for economic profit, and old kilns such as Seto restarted as porcelain kilns. These many kilns are called \"New Kilns\" and they popularized porcelain in the style of the Arita kilns among the common folk.\\n\\n\\n=== Meiji period ===\\n\\nDuring the international openness of the Meiji period, Japanese arts and crafts had a new audience and set of influences. Traditional patrons such as the daimyō class broke away and many of the artisans lost their source of income. The government took an active interest in the art export market, promoting Japanese arts at a succession of world\\'s fairs, beginning with the 1873 Vienna World\\'s Fair. The Imperial Household also took an active interest in arts and crafts, appointing Imperial Household Artists and commissioning works (\"presentation wares\") as gifts for foreign dignitaries. Most of the works promoted internationally were in the decorative arts, including pottery.\\nSatsuma ware was a name originally given to pottery from Satsuma province, elaborately decorated with overglaze enamels and gilding. These wares were highly praised in the West. Seen in the West as distinctively Japanese, this style actually owed a lot to imported pigments and Western influences, and had been created with export in mind. Workshops in many cities raced to produce this style to satisfy demand from Europe and America, often producing quickly and cheaply. So the term \"Satsuma ware\" came to be associated not with a place of origin but with lower-quality ware created purely for export. Despite this, there were artists such as Yabu Meizan and Makuzu Kōzan who maintained the highest artistic standards while also successfully exporting. These artists won multiple awards at international exhibitions. Meizan used copper plates to create detailed designs and repeatedly transfer them to the pottery, sometimes decorating a single object with a thousand motifs.\\nJapan\\'s porcelain industry was well-established at the start of the Meiji period, but the mass-produced wares were not known for their elegance. During this era, technical and artistic innovations turned porcelain into one of the most internationally successful Japanese decorative art forms. A lot of this is due to Makuzu Kōzan, known for Satsuma ware, who from the 1880s onwards introduced new technical sophistication to the decoration of porcelain, while committed to preserving traditional artistic values. During the 1890s he developed a style of decoration that combined multiple underglaze colours on each item. The technical sophistication of his underglazes increased during this decade as he continued to experiment. In the decade from 1900 to 1910 there was a substantial change in the shape and decoration of his works, reflecting Western influences. His work strongly influenced Western perceptions of Japanese design.\\n\\n\\n=== Taishō period ===\\nJapanese pottery strongly influenced British studio potter Bernard Leach (1887–1979), who is regarded as the \"Father of British studio pottery\". He lived in Japan from 1909 to 1920 during the Taishō period and became the leading western interpreter of Japanese pottery and in turn influenced a number of artists abroad.\\n\\n\\n=== Shōwa period ===\\n\\nDuring the early Shōwa period, the folk art movement mingei (民芸) developed, starting in the late 1920s and 1930s. Its founding father was Yanagi Sōetsu (1889–1961). Yanagi was deeply moved by the quiet beauty of utilitarian wares made by common people—particularly simple, unpretentious pots and tools from the Edo and Meiji periods—that were rapidly vanishing in Japan’s increasingly urban and mechanized society. He rescued lowly pots used by commoners in the Edo and Meiji period that were disappearing in rapidly urbanizing Japan. Shōji Hamada (1894–1978) was a potter who was a major figure of the mingei movement, establishing the town of Mashiko as a renowned centre for Mashiko ware. Another influential potter in this movement was Kawai Kanjirō (1890–1966) and Tatsuzō Shimaoka (1919–2007). Shimaoka became renowned for his innovative jōmon zogan (rope-impressed inlay) technique, which fused modern creativity with ancient aesthetics, earning him the status of Living National Treasure in 1996. These artists studied traditional glazing techniques to preserve native wares in danger of disappearing, blending folk traditions with a personal spiritual sensibility, believing that beauty should be found in the act of making, not just in the final form. Both men embraced Yanagi’s vision, not merely as craftspeople but as artist-philosophers committed to preserving Japan’s cultural heritage. A central goal of these artists was to study, preserve, and revive traditional glazing and firing techniques, many of which were in danger of disappearing as Japan modernized. Their efforts were not simply nostalgic but rooted in a belief that handcrafted, everyday objects carried a deep connection to place, purpose, and human touch.\\nHowever, one of the most critical and challenging periods for the mingei movement came during the Pacific War (1941–1945). With the nation\\'s resources redirected toward the war effort, artisanal production was severely curtailed. Materials such as clay, fuel, and glazes became scarce, and artistic practice gave way to utilitarian demands. Pottery workshops were shuttered or repurposed, and the market for handmade wares all but collapsed. Yet, despite these obstacles, the ideals of mingeiendured. In the post-war years, the movement experienced a resurgence, thanks in large part to the unwavering commitment of its key figures and the international recognition they began to receive.\\n\\n\\n=== Heisei period to present ===\\nA number of institutions came under the aegis of the Cultural Properties Protection Division.\\nThe kilns at Tamba, overlooking Kobe, continued to produce the daily wares used in the Tokugawa period, while adding modern shapes. Most of the village wares were made anonymously by local potters for utilitarian purposes. Local styles, whether native or imported, tended to be continued without alteration into the present. In Kyūshū, kilns set up by Korean potters in the 16th century, such as at Koishiwara, Fukuoka and its offshoot at Onta ware, perpetuated 16th-century Korean peasant wares. In Okinawa, the production of village ware continued under several leading masters, with Jiro Kinjo honored as a ningen kokuho (人間国宝, lit.\\u2009\\'living cultural treasures\\', officially a Preserver of Important Intangible Cultural Properties).\\nThe modern potters operate in Shiga, Iga, Karatsu, Hagi, and Bizen. Yamamoto Masao (Toushuu) of Bizen and Miwa Kyusetsu of Hagi were designated ningen kokuho. Only a half-dozen potters had been so honored by 1989, either as representatives of famous kiln wares or as creators of superlative techniques in glazing or decoration; two groups were designated for preserving the wares of distinguished ancient kilns.\\nIn the old capital of Kyoto, the Raku family continued to produce the rough tea bowls that had so delighted Hideyoshi. At Mino, potters continued to reconstruct the classic formulas of Momoyama period Seto-type tea wares of Mino, such as the Oribe ware copper-green glaze and Shino ware\\'s prized milky glaze. Artist potters experimented at the Kyoto and Tokyo arts universities to recreate traditional porcelain and its decorations under such ceramic teachers as Fujimoto Yoshimichi, a ningen kokuho. Ancient porcelain kilns around Arita in Kyūshū were still maintained by the lineage of Sakaida Kakiemon XIV and Imaizumi Imaemon XIII, hereditary porcelain makers to the Nabeshima clan; both were heads of groups designated mukei bunkazai (無形文化財; see Kakiemon and Imari porcelain).\\nBritish artist Lucie Rie (1902–1995) was influenced by Japanese pottery and Bernard Leach, and was also appreciated in Japan with a number of exhibitions. British artist Edmund de Waal (b. 1964) studied Leach and spent a number of years in Japan studying mingei style. Thomas Bezanson from Canada was influenced by it.\\nIn contrast, by the end of the 1980s, many studio potters no longer worked at major or ancient kilns but were making classic wares in various parts of Japan. In Tokyo, a notable example is Tsuji Seimei, who brought his clay from Shiga but potted in the Tokyo area. A number of artists were engaged in reconstructing Chinese styles of decoration or glazes, especially the blue-green celadon and the watery-green qingbai. One of the most beloved Chinese glazes in Japan is the chocolate-brown tenmoku glaze that covered the peasant tea bowls brought back from southern Song China (in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries) by Zen monks. For their Japanese users, these chocolate-brown wares embodied the Zen aesthetic of wabi (rustic simplicity). In the United States, an example of the use of tenmoku glazes are pots thrown by Japanese-born artist Hideaki Miyamura.\\n\\n\\n== Raw materials ==\\nRaw materials are chosen largely based on local availability.  There is an abundance of many basic in Japan. Due to naturally occurring kaolin deposits, many clays are found in Kyushu. Kilns were traditionally built at the sites of clay deposits, and most studio potters still use local clays, having developed a range of glazes and decoration techniques especially suited to that clay. Raw materials found in the Japanese archipelago range from those suitable for earthenwares to more refractory kaolins. From the Jōmon period to the Yayoi period, Japanese potters relied on high plastic iron-bearing shale and alluvial clays. Organic materials appear in much of the early Jōmon period work, but sand or crushed stone predominates thereafter.\\nFurther refinements came about under the Chinese influence in the 8th and 9th centuries AD, when creators of Nara three-color wares and Heian ash glazed wares sought out white, refractory clays and enhanced their fineness through levigation.\\n\\n\\n== Traditional shaping methods ==\\n\\nThe earliest pieces were made by pressing the clay into shape. This method continued to be employed after the invention of the wheel, such as when producing Rengetsu ware. Coiled methods developed in the Jōmon period. Production by kneading and cutting slabs developed later, for example, for haniwa clay figures.\\n\\n\\n=== Coil and throw ===\\nAt Koishibara, Onda, and Tamba, large bowls and jars are first roughly coil-built on the wheel, then shaped by throwing, in what is known as the \"coil and throw technique\". The preliminary steps are the same as for coil building, after which the rough form is lubricated with slip and shaped between the potter\\'s hands as the wheel revolves. The process dates back 360 years to a Korean technique brought to Japan following Hideyoshi\\'s invasion of Korea.\\n\\n\\n=== Tools ===\\nGenerally fashioned out of fast-growing bamboo or wood, these tools for shaping pottery have a natural feel that is highly appealing. While most are Japanese versions of familiar tools in the West, some are unique Japanese inventions.\\n\\nGyūbera or \"cows\\' tongues\" are long sled-shaped bamboo ribs used to compress the bottoms and shape the sides of straight-sided bowls. They are a traditional tool from Arita, Kyushu.\\nMarugote are round, shallow clam shell-shaped bamboo ribs used to shape the sides of curved bowls. They can also be used to compress the bottoms of thrown forms.\\nDango, similar to wooden ribs, are leaf-shaped bamboo ribs used to shape and smooth the surfaces of a pot.\\nTakebera are bamboo trimming and modeling \"knives\" available in several different shapes for carving, cleaning up wet pots, cutting, and for producing sgraffito effects.\\nTonbo, \"dragonflies\", are the functional equivalent of Western calipers with an added feature. Suspended from a takebera or balanced on the rim of a pot, these delicate bamboo tools are used for measuring both the diameter and the depth of thrown forms.\\nYumi are wire and bamboo trimming harps that double as a fluting tool. They are used to cut off uneven or torn rims as well as to facet leather-hard forms.\\nTsurunokubi, \"cranes\\' necks\", are s-curved Japanese wooden throwing sticks used to shape the interiors of narrow-necked pieces such as bottles and certain vases.\\nKanna are cutting, carving and incising tools made of iron and used to trim pieces, for carving, sgraffito and for scraping off excess glaze.\\nA tsuchikaki is a large looped ribbon tool made of iron that can be used for trimming as well as carving.\\nAn umakaki is a trimming harp used to level flat, wide surfaces, such as the bottom of a shallow dish or plate.\\nKushi are not strictly throwing tools; these combs are used to score a minimum of two decorative parallel lines on pot surfaces. The largest combs have about 20 teeth.\\nA take bon bon is also not a throwing tool, but a Japanese slip-trailer. A take bon bon is a high-capacity bamboo bottle with a spout from which slip and glaze can be poured out in a steady, controlled stream so the potter can \"draw\" with it.\\n\\n\\n== Wares ==\\nHundreds of different wares and styles have existed throughout its history. The most historic and well-known ones have received recognition from the government. For more information see the list of Japanese ceramics sites.\\n\\n\\n== Museums and collections ==\\n\\nA number of museums in Japan are dedicated entirely only to ceramics. Amongst the most well-known ones are the Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum close to Nagoya, the Arita Porcelain Park, the Fukuoka Oriental Ceramics Museum, the Kyushu Ceramic Museum, the Noritake Garden, the Museum of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka, the Okayama Prefectural Bizen Ceramics Museum, and the Ōtsuka Museum of Art. Public museums such as the Kyushu National Museum, Kyoto National Museum, Nara National Museum, Tokyo National Museum and Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art have important ceramic collections. A number of private museums also have important items such as the MOA Museum of Art, Mitsui Memorial Museum, Seikadō Bunko Art Museum, Fujita Art Museum and Kubosō Memorial Museum of Arts, Izumi. A number of important ceramic items are also owned and kept in various temples in Japan such as the Ryūkō-in, Kohō-an and Shōkoku-ji, however the items are not exhibited publicly.\\nMost ceramic museums around the world have collections of Japanese pottery, many very extensive.  Japanese modern ceramic works are often very sought-after and expensive. Apart from traditional styles art and studio pottery in contemporary art styles are made for the international market.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nJapanese craft\\nJapanese art\\nChinese ceramics\\nKorean pottery and porcelain\\nKintsugi\\nList of National Treasures of Japan (crafts: others)\\nTokanabe\\nList of Traditional Crafts of Japan\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Bibliography ===\\nEarle, Joe (1999).

       " Document(metadata={'title': '19th century', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_century'}, page_content='The 19th century began on 1 January 1801 (represented by the Roman numerals MDCCCI), and ended on 31 December 1900 (MCM). It was the 9th century of the 2nd millennium. It was characterized by vast social upheaval. Slavery was abolished in much of Europe and the Americas. The First Industrial Revolution, though it began in the late 18th century, expanded beyond its British homeland for the first time during the 19th century, particularly remaking the economies and societies of the Low Countries, France, the Rhineland, Northern Italy, and the Northeastern United States. A few decades later, the Second Industrial Revolution led to ever more massive urbanization and much higher levels of productivity, profit, and prosperity, a pattern that continued into the 20th century. The Catholic Church, in response to the growing influence and power of modernism, secularism and materialism, formed the First Vatican Council in the late 19th century to deal with such problems and confirm certain Catholic doctrines as dogma. Religious missionaries were sent from the Americas and Europe to Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\\nIn the Middle East, it was an era of change and reform. The Islamic gunpowder empires fell into decline and European imperialism brought much of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and almost all of Africa under colonial rule. Reformers were opposed at every turn by conservatives who strove to maintain the centuries-old Islamic laws and social order. The 19th century also saw the collapse of the large Spanish, Portuguese, French and Mughal empires, which paved the way for the growing influence of the British, French, German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, Italian, and Japanese empires along with the United States.\\nFollowing the defeat of France in the Napoleonic Wars, it marked the end of France’s status as the world superpower. Britain took France’s status as the world superpower, the British and Russian empires expanded considerably, becoming two of the world\\'s leading powers. Russia expanded its territory to the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Ottoman Empire underwent a period of Westernization and reform known as the Tanzimat, vastly increasing its control over core territories in the Middle East. However, it remained in decline and became known as the sick man of Europe, losing territory in the Balkans and North Africa.\\nThe remaining powers in the Indian subcontinent, such as the Maratha and Sikh empires, suffered a massive decline, and their dissatisfaction with the British East India Company\\'s rule led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the company\\'s dissolution. India was later ruled directly by the British Crown through the establishment of the British Raj. During the post-Napoleonic era (after 1815), Britain enforced what became known as the Pax Britannica, which ushered in unprecedented globalization on a massive scale. Britain\\'s overseas possessions grew rapidly in the first half of the century, especially with the expansion of vast territories in Canada, Australia, India, and in the last two decades of the century in Africa. By the end of the 19th century, the British controlled a fifth of the world\\'s land and a quarter of the world\\'s population.\\nBy the end of the century, Britain, France, Germany, and the United States had colonized almost all of Oceania. In East Asia, China under the Qing dynasty endured its century of humiliation by foreign powers that lasted until the first half of the 20th century. The last surviving man and woman, respectively, verified to have been born in the 19th century were Jiroemon Kimura (1897–2013) and Nabi Tajima (1900–2018), both Japanese.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\n\\nThe first electronics appeared in the 19th century, with the introduction of the electric relay in 1835, the telegraph and its Morse code protocol in 1837, the first telephone call in 1876, and the first functional light bulb in 1878.\\nThe 19th century was an era of rapidly accelerating scientific discovery and invention, with significant developments in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, electricity, and metallurgy that laid the groundwork for the technological advances of the 20th century. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and spread to continental Europe, North America, and Japan. The Victorian era was notorious for the employment of young children in factories and mines, as well as strict social norms regarding modesty and gender roles. Japan embarked on a program of rapid modernization following the Meiji Restoration, before defeating China, under the Qing dynasty, in the First Sino-Japanese War. Advances in medicine and the understanding of human anatomy and disease prevention took place in the 19th century, and were partly responsible for rapidly accelerating population growth in the Western world. Europe\\'s population doubled during the 19th century, from approximately 200 million to more than 400 million. The introduction of railroads provided the first major advancement in land transportation for centuries, changing the way people lived and obtained goods, and fuelling major urbanization movements in countries across the globe. Numerous cities worldwide surpassed populations of a million or more during this century. London became the world\\'s largest city and capital of the British Empire. Its population increased from 1 million in 1800 to 6.7 million a century later. The last remaining undiscovered landmasses of Earth, including vast expanses of interior Africa and Asia, were explored during this century, and with the exception of the extreme zones of the Arctic and Antarctic, accurate and detailed maps of the globe were available by the 1890s. Liberalism became the pre-eminent reform movement in Europe.\\n\\nSlavery was greatly reduced around the world. Following a successful slave revolt in Haiti, Britain and France stepped up the battle against the Barbary pirates and succeeded in stopping their enslavement of Europeans. The UK\\'s Slavery Abolition Act 1833 charged the British Royal Navy with ending the global slave trade. The first colonial empire in the century to abolish slavery was the British, who did so in 1834. America\\'s Thirteenth Amendment following their Civil War abolished slavery there in 1865, and in Brazil slavery was abolished in 1888 (see abolitionism). Similarly, serfdom was abolished in Russia in 1861.\\nThe 19th century was remarkable in the widespread formation of new settlement foundations which were particularly prevalent across North America and Australia, with a significant proportion of the two continents\\' largest cities being founded at some point in the century. Chicago in the United States and Melbourne in Australia were non-existent in the earliest decades but grew to become the 2nd largest cities in the United States and British Empire respectively by the end of the century. In the 19th century, approximately 70 million people left Europe, with most migrating to the United States.\\nThe 19th century also saw the rapid creation, development, and codification of many sports, particularly in Britain and the United States. Association football, rugby union, baseball, and many other sports were developed during the 19th century, while the British Empire facilitated the rapid spread of sports such as cricket to many different parts of the world. Also, women\\'s fashion was a very sensitive topic during this time, as women showing their ankles was viewed to be scandalous.\\n\\nIt also marks the fall of the Ottoman rule of the Balkans which led to the creation of Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Romania as a result of the second Russo-Turkish War, which in itself followed the great Crimean War.\\n\\n\\n=== Eras ===\\n\\nIndustrial Revolution\\nEuropean imperialism\\nBritish Regency, Victorian era (UK, British Empire)\\nBourbon Restoration, July Monarchy, French Second Republic, Second French Empire, French Third Republic (France)\\nRisorgimento (Italy)\\nBelle Époque (Europe)\\nEdo period, Meiji period (Japan)\\nQing dynasty (China)\\nNguyen dynasty (Vietnam)\\nJoseon dynasty (Korea)\\nZulu Kingdom (South Africa)\\nTanzimat, First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)\\nRussian Empire\\nManifest destiny, Antebellum era, Reconstruction era, American frontier, Gilded Age (United States)\\n\\n\\n== Wars ==\\n\\n\\n=== Napoleonic Wars ===\\n\\nThe Napoleonic Wars were a series of major conflicts from 1803 to 1815 pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, financed and usually led by the United Kingdom. The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and its resultant conflict.\\nIn the aftermath of the French Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte gained power in France in 1799. In 1804, he crowned himself Emperor of the French.\\nIn 1805, the French victory over an Austrian-Russian army at the Battle of Austerlitz ended the War of the Third Coalition. As a result of the Treaty of Pressburg, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved.\\n\\nLater efforts were less successful. In the Peninsular War, France unsuccessfully attempted to establish Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain. In 1812, the French invasion of Russia had massive French casualties, and was a turning point in the Napoleonic Wars.In 1814, after defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition, Napoleon abdicated and was exiled to Elba. Later that year, he escaped exile and began the Hundred Days before finally being defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to Saint Helena, an island in the South Atlantic Ocean.\\nAfter Napoleon\\'s defeat, the Congress of Vienna was held to determine new national borders. The Concert of Europe attempted to preserve this settlement was established to preserve these borders, with limited impact.\\n\\n\\n=== Latin American independence ===\\n\\nMexico and the majority of the countries in Central America and South America obtained independence from colonial overlords during the 19th century. In 1804, Haiti gained independence from France. In Mexico, the Mexican War of Independence was a decade-long conflict that ended in Mexican independence in 1821.\\nDue to the Napoleonic Wars, the royal family of Portugal relocated to Brazil from 1808 to 1821, leading to Brazil having a separate monarchy from Portugal.\\nThe Federal Republic of Central America gained independence from Spain in 1821 and from Mexico in 1823. After several rebellions, by 1841 the federation had dissolved into the independent countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.\\nIn 1830, the post-colonial nation of Gran Colombia dissolved and the nations of Colombia (including modern-day Panama), Ecuador, and Venezuela took its place.\\n\\n\\n=== Revolutions of 1848 ===\\n\\nThe Revolutions of 1848 were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. The revolutions were essentially democratic and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing the old monarchical structures and creating independent nation states.\\nThe first revolution began in January in Sicily. Revolutions then spread across Europe after a separate revolution began in France in February. Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among their respective revolutionaries.\\nAccording to Evans and von Strandmann (2000), some of the major contributing factors were widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership, demands for more participation in government and democracy, demands for freedom of the press, other demands made by the working class, the upsurge of nationalism, and the regrouping of established government forces.\\n\\n\\n=== Abolition and the American Civil War ===\\n\\nThe abolitionism movement achieved success in the 19th century. The Atlantic slave trade was abolished in the United States in 1808, and by the end of the century, almost every government had banned slavery. The Slavery Abolition Act 1833 banned slavery throughout the British Empire, and the Lei Áurea abolished slavery in Brazil in 1888.\\nAbolitionism in the United States continued until the end of the American Civil War. Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman were two of many American abolitionists who helped win the fight against slavery. Douglass was an articulate orator and incisive antislavery writer, while Tubman worked with a network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad.\\nThe American Civil War took place from 1861 to 1865. Eleven southern states seceded from the United States, largely over concerns related to slavery. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln issued a preliminary on September 22, 1862, warning that in all states still in rebellion (Confederacy) on January 1, 1863, he would declare their slaves \"then, thenceforward, and forever free.\" He did so. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1865, officially abolished slavery in the entire country.\\nFive days after Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia, Lincoln was assassinated by actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth.\\n\\n\\n=== Decline of the Ottoman Empire ===\\n\\nIn 1817, the Principality of Serbia became suzerain from the Ottoman Empire, and in 1867, it passed a constitution that defined its independence from the Ottoman Empire. In 1830, Greece became the first country to break away from the Ottoman Empire after the Greek War of Independence. In 1831, the Bosnian Uprising against Ottoman rule occurred. In 1831, The First Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833) occurred, between the Ottoman Empire and Egypt brought about by Muhammad Ali Pasha\\'s demand to the Sublime Porte for control of Greater Syria, as reward for aiding the Sultan during the Greek War of Independence. As a result, Egyptian forces temporarily gained control of Syria, advancing as far north as Kütahya. In 1876, Bulgarians instigated the April Uprising against Ottoman rule. Following the Russo-Turkish War, the Treaty of Berlin recognized the formal independence of the Serbia, Montenegro, and Romania. Bulgaria became autonomous.\\n\\n\\n=== China: Taiping Rebellion ===\\n\\nThe Taiping Rebellion was the bloodiest conflict of the 19th century, leading to the deaths of around 20–30 million people. Its leader, Hong Xiuquan, declared himself the younger brother of Jesus Christ and developed a new Chinese religion known as the God Worshipping Society. After proclaiming the establishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in 1851, the Taiping army conquered a large part of China, capturing Nanjing in 1853. In 1864, after the death of Hong Xiuquan, Qing forces recaptured Nanjing and ended the rebellion.\\n\\n\\n=== Japan: Meiji Restoration ===\\n\\nDuring the Edo period, Japan largely pursued an isolationist foreign policy. In 1853, United States Navy Commodore Matthew C. Perry threatened the Japanese capital Edo with gunships, demanding that they agree to open trade. This led to the opening of trade relations between Japan and foreign countries, with the policy of Sakoku formally ended in 1854.\\nBy 1872, the Japanese government under Emperor Meiji had eliminated the daimyō system and established a strong central government. Further reforms included the abolition of the samurai class, rapid industrialization and modernization of government, closely following European models.\\n\\n\\n=== Colonialism ===\\n\\n1803: United States more than doubles in size when it buys out France\\'s territorial claims in North America via the Louisiana Purchase. This begins the U.S.\\'s westward expansion to the Pacific, referred to as its Manifest Destiny, which involves annexing and conquering land from Mexico, Britain, and Native Americans.\\n1817 – 1819: British Empire annexed the Maratha Confederacy after the Third Anglo-Maratha War.\\n1823 – 1887: British Empire annexed Burma (now also called Myanmar) after three Anglo-Burmese Wars.\\n1848 – 1849: Sikh Empire is defeated in the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Therefore, the entire Indian subcontinent is under British control.\\n1862: France gained its first foothold in Southeast Asia and in 1863 annexed Cambodia.\\n1867: United States purchased Alaska from Russia.\\n\\n\\n==== Africa ====\\n\\nIn Africa, European exploration and technology led to the colonization of almost the entire continent by 1898. New medicines such as quinine and more advanced firearms allowed European nations to conquer native populations.\\nMotivations for the Scramble for Africa included national pride, desire for raw materials, and Christian missionary activity. Britain seized control of Egypt to ensure control of the Suez Canal, but Ethiopia defeated Italy in the First Italo–Ethiopian War at the Battle of Adwa. France, Belgium, Portugal, and Germany also had substantial colonies. The Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 attempted to reach agreement on colonial borders in Africa, but disputes continued, both amongst European powers and in resistance by the native populations.\\nIn 1867, diamonds were discovered in the Kimberley region of South Africa. In 1886, gold was discovered in Transvaal. This led to colonization in Southern Africa by the British and business interests, led by Cecil Rhodes.\\n\\n\\n=== Other wars ===\\n1801–1815: First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War between the United States and the Barbary States of North Africa.\\n1802: Tay Son army recaptured Phu Xuan, causing Vo Tanh to commit suicide, Nguyen Phuc Anh successfully captured Thang Long, founded the Nguyen dynasty\\n1804–1810: Fulani Jihad in Nigeria.\\n1804–1813: Russo-Persian War.\\n1806–1812: Russo-Turkish War, Treaty of Bucharest.\\n1807–1837: Musket Wars among Māori in many parts of New Zealand.\\n1808–1809: Russia conquers Finland from Sweden in the Finnish War.\\n1810: Grito de Dolores begins the Mexican War of Independence.\\n1811: Battle of Tippecanoe: U.S. outnumbering Native Americans resulting in defeat and burning of community\\n1812–1815: War of 1812 between the United States and Britain; ends in a draw, except that Native Americans lose power.\\n1813–1837: Afghan–Sikh Wars.\\n1814–1816: Anglo-Nepalese War between Nepal (Gurkha Empire) and British Empire.\\n1817: First Seminole War begins in Florida.\\n1817: Russia commences its conquest of the Caucasus.\\n1820: Revolutions of 1820 in Southern Europe\\n1821–1830: Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire.\\n1825–1830: Java War begins.\\n1826–1828: After the final Russo-Persian War, the Persian Empire took back territory lost to Russia from the previous war.\\n1828–1832: Black War in Tasmania leads to the near extinction of the Tasmanian aborigines\\n1830: July Revolution overthrew old line of Bourbons.\\n1830: November Uprising in Poland against Russia.\\n1830: Belgian Revolution results in Belgium\\'s independence from Netherlands.\\n1830: End of the Java War.

Among the most influential ideas of the 19th century were those of Charles Darwin (alongside the independent researches of Alfred Russel Wallace), who in 1859 published the book The Origin of Species, which introduced the idea of evolution by natural selection. Another important landmark in medicine and biology were the successful efforts to prove the germ theory of disease. Following this, Louis Pasteur made the first vaccine against rabies, and also made many discoveries in the field of chemistry, including the asymmetry of crystals. In chemistry, Dmitri Mendeleev, following the atomic theory of John Dalton, created the first periodic table of elements. In physics, the experiments, theories and discoveries of Michael Faraday, André-Marie Ampère, James Clerk Maxwell, and their contemporaries led to the creation of electromagnetism as a new branch of science. Thermodynamics led to an understanding of heat and the notion of energy was defined. Other highlights include the discoveries unveiling the nature of atomic structure and matter, simultaneously with chemistry – and of new kinds of radiation. In astronomy, the planet Neptune was discovered. In mathematics, the notion of complex numbers finally matured and led to a subsequent analytical theory; they also began the use of hypercomplex numbers. Karl Weierstrass and others carried out the arithmetization of analysis for functions of real and complex variables. It also saw rise to new progress in geometry beyond those classical theories of Euclid, after a period of nearly two thousand years. The mathematical science of logic likewise had revolutionary breakthroughs after a similarly long period of stagnation. But the most important step in science at this time were the ideas formulated by the creators of electrical science. Their work changed the face of physics and made possible for new technology to come about including a rapid spread in the use of electric illumination and power in the last two decades of the century and radio wave communication at the end of the 1890s.\\n\\n1807: Potassium and Sodium are individually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy.\\n1831–1836: Charles Darwin\\'s journey on HMS Beagle.\\n1859: Charles Darwin publishes On the Origin of Species.\\n1861: James Clerk Maxwell publishes On Physical Lines of Force, formulating the four Maxwell\\'s equations.\\n1865: Gregor Mendel formulates his laws of inheritance.\\n1869: Dmitri Mendeleev creates the Periodic table.\\n1873: Maxwell\\'s A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism published.\\n1877: Asaph Hall discovers the moons of Mars\\n1896: Henri Becquerel discovers radioactivity; J.

William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge are considered the initiators of the new school in England, while in the continent the German Sturm und Drang spreads its influence as far as Italy and Spain. French arts had been hampered by the Napoleonic Wars but subsequently developed rapidly. Modernism began.\\nThe Goncourts and Émile Zola in France and Giovanni Verga in Italy produce some of the finest naturalist novels. Italian naturalist novels are especially important in that they give a social map of the new unified Italy to a people that until then had been scarcely aware of its ethnic and cultural diversity. There was a huge literary output during the 19th century. Some of the most famous writers included the Russians Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky; the English Charles Dickens, John Keats, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Jane Austen; the Scottish Sir Walter Scott, Thomas Carlyle and Arthur Conan Doyle (creator of the character Sherlock Holmes); the Irish Oscar Wilde; the Americans Edgar Allan Poe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Mark Twain; and the French Victor Hugo, Honoré de Balzac, Jules Verne, Alexandre Dumas and Charles Baudelaire.\\nSome American literary writers, poets and novelists were: Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Harriet Ann Jacobs, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Joel Chandler Harris, and Emily Dickinson to name a few.\\n\\n\\n=== Photography ===\\n\\nOttomar Anschütz, chronophotographer\\nMathew Brady, documented the American Civil War\\nEdward S.

In the United States the Hudson River School was prominent. 19th-century painters included:\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nSonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century. Much of the music from the 19th century was referred to as being in the Romantic style. Many great composers lived through this era such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Liszt, Frédéric Chopin, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Richard Wagner. The list includes:\\n\\n\\n=== Sports ===\\n1858: The Melbourne Football Club was formed, starting the sport of Australian Rules Football\\n1867: The Marquess of Queensberry Rules for boxing are published.\\n1872: The first recognised international football match, between England and Scotland, is played.\\n1877: The first test cricket match, between England and Australia, is played.\\n1891: Basketball is invented by James Naismith.\\n1895: Volleyball is invented.\\n1896: Olympic Games revived in Athens.\\n\\n\\n== Events ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1801–1850 ===\\n\\n1801: The Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merge to form the United Kingdom.\\n1801: Thomas Jefferson is elected the third President of the United States; he serves until 1809.\\n1802: The Wahhabis of the First Saudi State sack Karbala.\\n1803: William Symington demonstrates his Charlotte Dundas, the \"first practical steamboat\".\\n1803: The Wahhabis of the First Saudi State capture Mecca and Medina.\\n1804: Austrian Empire founded by Francis I.\\n1804: World population reaches 1 billion.\\n1805: The Battle of Trafalgar eliminates the French and Spanish naval fleets and allows for British dominance of the seas, a major factor for the success of the British Empire later in the century.\\n1805–1848: Muhammad Ali modernizes Egypt.\\n\\n1810: The University of Berlin was founded.

       " Document(metadata={'title': 'Chinese ceramics', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_ceramics'}, page_content='Chinese ceramics are one of the most significant forms of Chinese art and ceramics globally. They range from construction materials such as bricks and tiles, to hand-built pottery vessels fired in bonfires or kilns, to the sophisticated Chinese porcelain wares made for the imperial court and for export.\\nThe oldest known pottery in the world was made during the Paleolithic at Xianrendong Cave, Jiangxi Province, China. Chinese ceramics show a continuous development since pre-dynastic times. Porcelain was a Chinese invention and is so identified with China that it is still called \"china\" in everyday English usage.\\n\\nMost later Chinese ceramics, even of the finest quality, were made on an industrial scale, thus few names of individual potters were recorded. Many of the most important kiln workshops were owned by or reserved for the emperor, and large quantities of Chinese export porcelain were exported as diplomatic gifts or for trade from an early date, initially to East Asia and the Islamic world, and then from around the 16th century to Europe. Chinese ceramics have had an enormous influence on other ceramic traditions in these areas.\\nIncreasingly over their long history, Chinese ceramics can be classified between those made for the imperial court to use or distribute, those made for a discriminating Chinese market, and those for popular Chinese markets or for export. Some types of wares were also made only or mainly for special uses such as burial in tombs, or for use on altars.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology and categories ==\\n\\nThe earliest Chinese pottery was earthenware, which continued in production for utilitarian uses throughout Chinese history, but was increasingly less used for fine wares. Stoneware, fired at higher temperatures, and naturally impervious to water, was developed very early and continued to be used for fine pottery in many areas at most periods; the tea bowls in Jian ware and Jizhou ware made during the Song dynasty are examples.\\n\\nPorcelain, on a Western definition, is \"a collective term comprising all ceramic ware that is white and translucent, no matter what ingredients are used to make it or to what use it is put\". The Chinese tradition recognizes two primary categories of ceramics: high-fired (cí 瓷) and low-fired (táo 陶), so doing without the intermediate category of stoneware, which in Chinese tradition is mostly grouped with (and translated as) porcelain. Terms such as \"porcellaneous\" or \"near-porcelain\" may be used for stonewares with porcelain-like characteristics.  The Erya defined porcelain (cí) as \"fine, compact pottery (táo)\".\\nChinese pottery can also be classified as being either northern or southern. China comprises two separate and geologically different land masses, brought together by continental drift and forming a junction that lies between the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, sometimes known as the Nanshan-Qinling divide. The contrasting geology of the north and south led to differences in the raw materials available for making ceramics; in particular the north lacks petunse or \"porcelain stone\", needed for porcelain on the strict definition. Ware-types can be from very widespread kiln-sites in either north or south China, but the two can nearly always be distinguished, and influences across this divide may affect shape and decoration, but will be based on very different clay bodies, with fundamental effects. The kiln types were also different, and in the north the fuel was usually coal, as opposed to wood in the south, which often affects the wares. Southern materials have high silica, low alumina and high potassium oxide, the reverse of northern materials in each case. The northern materials are often very suitable for stoneware, while in the south there are also areas highly suitable for porcelain.\\n\\n\\n== Materials ==\\nChinese porcelain is mainly made by a combination of the following materials:\\n\\nKaolin – essential ingredient composed largely of the clay mineral kaolinite.\\nPorcelain stone – decomposed micaceous or feldspar rocks, historically also known as petunse.\\nFeldspar\\nQuartz\\n\\n\\n== Technical developments ==\\nIn the context of Chinese ceramics, the term porcelain lacks a universally accepted definition (see above). This in turn has led to confusion about when the first Chinese porcelain was made. Claims have been made for the late Eastern Han dynasty (100–200 AD), the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD), the Six Dynasties period (220–589 AD), and the Tang dynasty (618–906 AD).\\nKiln technology has always been a key factor in the development of Chinese pottery. The Chinese developed effective kilns capable of firing at around 1,000 °C (1,830 °F) before 2000 BC. These were updraft kilns, often built below ground. Two main types of kilns were developed by about 200 AD and remained in use until modern times. These are the dragon kiln of hilly southern China, usually fuelled by wood, long and thin and running up a slope, and the horseshoe-shaped mantou kiln of the north Chinese plains, smaller and more compact. Both could reliably produce the temperatures of up to 1,300 °C (2,370 °F) or more needed for porcelain. In the late Ming, the egg-shaped kiln (zhenyao) was developed at Jingdezhen, but mainly used there. This was something of a compromise between the other types, and offered locations in the firing chamber with a range of firing conditions.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nImportant specific types of pottery, many coming from more than one period, are dealt with individually in sections lower down.\\n\\n\\n=== Neolithic ===\\n\\nPottery dating from 20,000 years ago was found at the Xianrendong Cave site in Jiangxi province, making it among the earliest pottery yet found. Another reported find is from 17,000 to 18,000 years ago in the Yuchanyan Cave in southern China.\\nBy the Middle and Late Neolithic (about 5000 to 1500 BCE) most of the larger archaeological cultures in China were farmers producing a variety of attractive and often large vessels, often boldly painted, or decorated by cutting or impressing. Decoration is abstract or of stylized animals – fish are a speciality at the river settlement of Banpo. The distinctive Majiayao pottery, with orange bodies and black paint, is characterised by fine paste textures, thin walls, and polished surfaces; the almost complete lack of defects in excavated pots suggests a high level of quality control during production. The Majiayao and other phases of the Yangshao culture are well-represented in Western museums, with Banshan pots as the most widely recognized type of Neolithic Chinese pottery in the West. Banshan urns are characterized by a short, narrow neck atop a wide-shouldered vessel tapering to an often very narrow base; there are usually two ring handles attached to the middle of the vessel, and the ornament is slip-painted in purplish black and plum-red pigments. The designs frequently comprise four large roundels, linked by strongly curved lines or loops.\\nDistinct from Central China ceramic tradition developed in the modern eastern coastal provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, with principal cultures like Dawenkou, Longshan, Majiabang, Songze, and Hemudu. The most significant technological aspect of ceramics in the region was the development of the fast wheel in the Dawenkou culture shortly after c. 3000 bce. East coast produced the most technologically advanced ceramics in Neolithic China and is best known for thin-walled, wheel-thrown, intricately shaped black pottery vessels that frequently had a burnished surface. The early Dawenkou vessels are made of red clay less carefully prepared than the fine Yangshao versions, but their forms are clearly articulated. They include the ceramic prototype of later bronze ding. Trilobed ewer known as gui (see illustration), which was also ancestor to a bronze vessel, date from the  mid- to late Dawenkou period. The stems and high feet of the raised Dawenkou vessels are often decorated with pierced openwork, a feature also of some black pottery of Longshan culture (see illustration). Smooth surface of black pottery is occasionally incised but never painted, giving it a metallic appearance. The white- or yellow-bodied wares that appeared towards the very end of the Dawenkou phase were further developed in the Longshan period, and many white wares either anticipate the bronze forms of the Shang era or have features such as rivets that suggest imitation of metalworking techniques, probably of contemporary copper wares, of which no examples have yet been discovered. All this heralded the transition from a lithic to a metallic culture and white wares are distant ancestors of much later white porcelain. Finds of vessels are mostly in burials; sometimes they hold the remains. One exceptional ritual site, Niuheliang in the far north, produced numerous human figurines, some about half life-size.\\n\\n\\n=== Bronze Age ===\\n\\nEarly Bronze Age was characterized by a growing skill in the firing and decoration of earthenware and improvements in technology as the widespread use of cast bronze encouraged developments in the handling of clays and in kiln control. In addition, the use of the potter\\'s wheel became common during the Shang and early Zhou period. All of this led to the development in the 13th century BCE,  in the form of stoneware, of the first high-fired (cí 瓷) pottery. It was \"an entirely new type of ceramic that was not known anywhere else in the world\". Furnace-like kilns needed for stoneware could not suitably be placed in residential areas, which led to the beginning of the practice of setting up larger pottery-working areas close to the natural resources of clay, fuel, and water.\\nThe technology for producing high-fired pottery did not develop uniformly over China. The potters of the south could fire ceramics up to 1200 °C, at which point the clay material fused, and first stoneware appeared in today Zhejiang/Jiangsu. At the same time, southern potters lacked skills in forming ceramic vessels of all kinds and in using various clays and they didn\\'t use any true glaze. Northern China present a different chronology in the production of high-fired wares, probably due to establishment of strong political and economic center by the Shang dynasty. Many different types of earthenware were produced, although its clay were unsuited to firing to stoneware temperatures. A very fine white clay, with some kaolinite, was used to produce a white pottery. Low iron content of kaolinite means that pottery does not change color due to changes in the iron element and thus remains white. The firing temperature was usually around 1,000 °C, not high enough to realize full sintering and produce porcelain, but it was the first step in this direction. White pottery, already known in neolithic period, peaked in Shang era, but became rare during the reign of Western Zhou, perhaps due to the increased production of imprinted hard pottery and proto-porcelain.\\nHard pottery, imprinted with geometric patterns on the surface, was finer and harder than regular pottery. Its firing temperature reached 1,100 °C, almost reaching the level required for full sintering, and some of it had a certain luster like a thin layer of glaze. Another ceramic invention of the Shang period was proto-porcelain, which has three distinct features. First, it required a higher firing temperature, 1,100 to 1,200 °C or higher; second, it has glaze on its surface, and third, its material contained kaolinite. The earliest glazes were kiln glosses, which develop naturally at high temperatures as the surface of the body fuses with kiln debris such as wood ash, which acts as a flux. This could gave potters the idea of mixing burnt plant ash into diluted kaolinite mud, which was then applied to the surface of the greenwares. Such glaze, which contained plant ash and traces of iron, \"turned out to be yellow or brown when fired in an oxidizing flame and blue or bluish green when fired in a reducing flame\". \\nThis was the first type of celadon glaze in history of Chinese ceramics and therefore these kind of wares are sometimes called proto-celadon. Very rare in the Shang period, proto-porcelain was further developed in the Zhou period, together with imprinted hard pottery. Hard pottery and proto-porcelain, fired in similar temperatures and found in the same sites, use basically the same decoration techniques. Potters realized very quickly that an even finer surface on proto-porcelain could be produced if it was coated with a mixture of clay and lime. Gradually they also learn how to use different color effects by varying the quantity of iron oxide in the glaze. Southern potters for a long time produced variety of unglaze stoneware, but in Eastern Zhou period today Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Jiangxi gradually becomes the most important centre of the production of proto-porcelain\\nThe new custom, using pottery instead of bronze burial objects, started becoming popular in the Spring and Autumn period. In tombs of Eastern Zhou archaeologists found many pottery burial objects emulating different ritual bronzes (see illustration of ceramic ding). In the Warring States period new prominence was achieved by pottery with painting. It was made by firing plain greenware and then painting on the fired ware, with no further firing. Because of this, the colorings were prone to fading or peeling off, making such wares pure burial objects, not suitable for daily use. Similar to the burial pottery was practice of offering wooden and clay models of people as burial gifts, also established under the Zhou dynasty. The life-size Terracotta Army of the first emperor Qin Shi Huang is the most spectacular example of this funerary ceramics, but normally figures were small. From the Qin period the number of figures placed in tombs grew enormously.\\n\\n\\n=== Han dynasty, 202 BC – 220 AD ===\\n\\nOn some Chinese definitions, the first porcelain was made in Zhejiang province during the Eastern Han dynasty. Shards recovered from archaeological Eastern Han kiln sites estimated firing temperature ranged from 1,260 to 1,300 °C (2,300 to 2,370 °F). As far back as 1000 BC, the so-called \"porcelaneous wares\" or \"proto-porcelain wares\" were made using at least some kaolin fired at high temperatures. The dividing line between the two and true porcelain wares is not a clear one. Archaeological finds have pushed the dates to as early as the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD).\\nThe late Han years saw the early development of the peculiar art form of hunping, or \"soul jar\": a funerary jar whose top was decorated by a sculptural composition. This type of vessel became widespread during the following Jin dynasty (266–420) and the Six Dynasties.\\nThe tomb figures that were to recur in the Tang were popular across society, but with more emphasis than later on model houses and farm animals. Green-glazed pottery, using lead-glazed earthenware in part of the later sancai formula, was used for some of these, though not for wares for use, as the raw lead made the glaze poisonous.\\n\\n\\n=== Sui and Tang dynasties, 581–907 AD ===\\n\\nDuring the Sui and Tang dynasties (608 to 907 AD), a wide range of ceramics, low-fired and high-fired, were produced. These included the last significant fine earthenwares to be produced in China, mostly lead-glazed sancai (three-colour) wares. Many of the well-known lively Tang dynasty tomb figures, which were only made to be placed in elite tombs close to the capital in the north, are in sancai, while others are unpainted or were painted over a slip; the paint has now often fallen off. The sancai vessels too may have been mainly for tombs, which is where they are all found; the glaze was less toxic than in the Han, but perhaps still to be avoided for use at the dining table.\\nIn the south, the wares from the Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site in Tongguan are significant for their first regular use of underglaze painting; examples have been found in many places in the Islamic world. However, their production tailed off as underglaze painting remained a minor technique for several centuries.\\n\\nYue ware was the leading high-fired, lime-glazed celadon of the period, and was of very sophisticated design, patronized by the court. This was also the case with the northern porcelains of kilns in the provinces of Henan and Hebei, which for the first time met the Western and Eastern definition of porcelain, being both pure white and translucent. The white Xing ware and green Yue ware were considered the finest ceramics of north and south China respectively. One of the first mentions of porcelain by a foreigner was in the Chain of Chronicles, written by the Arab traveler and merchant Suleiman in 851 AD during the Tang dynasty who recorded that: They have in China a very fine clay with which they make vases which are as transparent as glass; water is seen through them. The vases are made of clay.\\nThis era\\'s potteries are exemplified by their colour and vibrancy, which was largely abandoned by the succeeding ages due to the adoption of Neo-Confucianism which opposed opulent displays and striking colours, and favoured modesty and simplicity above all else.\\n\\n\\n=== Liao, Song, Western Xia and Jin dynasties, 907–1276 ===\\n\\nThe pottery of the Song dynasty has retained enormous prestige in Chinese tradition, especially that of what later became known as the \"Five Great Kilns\". The artistic emphasis of Song pottery was on subtle glaze effects and graceful shapes; other decoration, where there was any, was mostly in shallow relief. Initially this was carved with a knife, but later moulds were used, with a loss of artistic quality. Painting was mostly used in the popular Cizhou ware. \"What is clear is that in the Song Dynasty which tended to uphold the esthetics of conventional Confucianism, underglaze blue was not at all popular; Confucian esthetics emphasized simplicity, and the underglaze blue designs were judged to be too ornamental.\"\\nGreen ware or celadons were popular, both in China and in export markets, which became increasingly important during the period. Yue ware was succeeded by Northern Celadon and then in the south Longquan celadon. White and black wares were also important, especially in Cizhou ware, and there were polychrome types, but the finer types of ceramics, for the court and the literati, remained monochrome, relying on glaze effects and shape. A wide variety of styles evolved in various areas, and those that were successful were imitated in other areas. Important kiln sites and stoneware styles included Ru, Jun, Southern Song Guan or official ware, Jian and Jizhou. Whitish porcelain continued to be improved, and included the continuation of Ding ware and the arrival of the qingbai which would replace it.\\n\\nThe Liao, Xia and Jin were founded by non-literate, often nomadic people who conquered parts of China. Pottery production continued under their rule, but their own artistic traditions merged to some extent with the Chinese, producing characteristic new styles.\\nThe fine pottery of all these regions was mainly high-fired, with some earthenware produced because of its lower cost and more colourful glazes. Some of the clay used was what is called kaolinite in the West. In some cases stoneware was preferred for its darker colour or better working qualities. Potteries used the local clay, and when that was dark or coarse and they wanted a fine white body, they covered the clay with white slip before applying glaze.\\n\\n\\n=== Yuan dynasty, 1271–1368 ===\\n\\nThe Mongol Yuan dynasty enforced the movement of artists of all sorts around the Mongol Empire, which in ceramics brought a major stylistic and technical influence from the Islamic world in the form of blue and white porcelain, with underglaze painting in cobalt. This has been described as the \"last great innovation in ceramic technology\". Decoration by underglaze painted patterns had long been a feature of Chinese pottery, especially in the popular Cizhou ware (mostly using black over slip), but was perhaps regarded as rather vulgar by the court and the literati class, and the finest ceramics were monochrome, using an understated aesthetic with perfect shapes and subtle glaze effects, often over shallow decoration carved or moulded into the surface.\\nThis was a great contrast to the bright colours and complicated designs developed under the Yuan, whose organization was mostly based on Islamic art, especially metalwork, although the animal and vegetable motifs remained based on Chinese tradition. These were initially mainly made for export, but became acceptable at court, and to buyers of fine ceramics internally. Export markets readily accepted the style, which has continued to be produced ever since, both in China and around the world.\\nBecause of this, improvements in water transportation and the re-unification under Mongol rule, pottery production started to concentrate near deposits of kaolin, such as Jingdezhen, which gradually became the pre-eminent centre for producing porcelain in a variety of styles, a position it has held ever since. The scale of production greatly increased, and the scale and organization of the kilns became industrialized, with ownership by commercial syndicates, much division of labour, and other typical features of mass production. Some other types of pottery, especially Longquan celadon and Cizhou ware, continued to flourish.\\n\\n\\n=== Ming dynasty, 1368–1644 ===\\n\\nThe Ming dynasty saw an extraordinary period of innovation in ceramic manufacture. Kilns investigated new techniques in design and shapes, showing a predilection for colour and painted design, and an openness to foreign forms. The Yongle Emperor (1402–24) was especially curious about other countries (as evidenced by his support of the eunuch Zheng He\\'s extended exploration of the Indian Ocean), and enjoyed unusual shapes, many inspired by Islamic metalwork. During the Xuande period (1426–35), a technical refinement was introduced in the preparation of the cobalt used for underglaze blue decoration.\\nPrior to this the cobalt had been brilliant in colour, but with a tendency to bleed in firing; by adding manganese the colour was duller, but the line crisper. Xuande porcelain is now considered among the finest of all Ming output. Enamelled decoration (such as the one at left) was perfected under the Chenghua Emperor (1464–87), and greatly prized by later collectors. Indeed, by the late 16th century, Chenghua and Xuande era works – especially wine cups – had grown so much in popularity, that their prices nearly matched genuine antique wares of the Song dynasty or even older. This esteem for relatively recent ceramics excited much scorn on the part of literati scholars (such as Wen Zhenheng, Tu Long, and Gao Lian, who is cited below); these men fancied themselves arbiters of taste and found the painted aesthetic \\'vulgar.\\'\\nIn addition to these decorative innovations, the late Ming dynasty underwent a dramatic shift towards a market economy, exporting porcelain around the world on an unprecedented scale. Thus aside from supplying porcelain for domestic use, the kilns at Jingdezhen became the main production centre for large-scale porcelain exports to Europe starting with the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1572–1620). By this time, kaolin and pottery stone were mixed in about equal proportions. Kaolin produced wares of great strength when added to the paste; it also enhanced the whiteness of the body—a trait that became a much sought after property, especially when form blue-and-white wares grew in popularity. Pottery stone could be fired at a lower temperature (1,250 °C; 2,280 °F) than paste mixed with kaolin, which required 1,350 °C (2,460 °F). These sorts of variations were important to keep in mind because the large southern egg-shaped kiln varied greatly in temperature. Near the firebox it was hottest; near the chimney, at the opposite end of the kiln, it was cooler.\\n\\n\\n=== Qing dynasty, 1644–1911 ===\\n\\nThe lengthy civil wars marking the transition from Ming to Qing caused a breakdown in the imperial kilns system, forcing the managers to find new markets. The Transitional porcelain of about 1620 to the 1680s saw a new style in painting, mostly in blue and white, with new subject-matter of landscapes and figures painted very freely, borrowing from other media. The later part of the period saw Europe joining the existing export markets.\\nThe Qing dynasty produced very varied porcelain styles, developing many of the innovations of the Ming. The most notable area of continuing innovation was in the increasing range of colours available, mostly in overglaze enamels. A very significant trade in Chinese export porcelain with the West developed. Court taste was highly eclectic, still favouring monochrome wares, which now used a wide range of bright glaze colours. Special glazing effects were highly regarded; new ones were developed and classic Song wares imitated with great skill. But the court now accepted wares with painted scenes in both blue and white and the new bright polychrome palettes. Technical standards at Jingdezhen were remarkably high, though falling somewhat by the middle of the 19th century.\\nDecoration, and sometimes shapes, became increasingly over-elaborate and fussy, and generally the Ming period is regarded as the greater; indeed in China this was the case at the time. By the 18th century the tradition had ceased to innovate in any radical way, and the vitality of painting declines.\\n\\nPrimary source material on Qing dynasty porcelain is available from both foreign residents and domestic authors. Two letters written by Père François Xavier d\\'Entrecolles, a Jesuit missionary and industrial spy who lived and worked in Jingdezhen in the early 18th century, described in detail manufacturing of porcelain in the city. In his first letter dated 1712, d\\'Entrecolles described the way in which pottery stones were crushed, refined and formed into little white bricks, known in Chinese as petuntse. He then went on to describe the refining of china clay kaolin along with the developmental stages of glazing and firing. He explained his motives:  Nothing but my curiosity could ever have prompted me to such researches, but it appears to me that a minute description of all that concerns this kind of work might, be useful in Europe.\\nIn 1743, during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, Tang Ying, the imperial supervisor in the city produced a memoir entitled Twenty Illustrations of the Manufacture of Porcelain. The original illustrations have been lost, but the text is still accessible.\\n\\n\\n== Types of Chinese pottery ==\\n\\n\\n=== Tang burial wares ===\\n\\nSancai means \"three-colours\": green, yellow and a creamy white, all in lead-based glazes. In fact some other colours could be used, including cobalt blue. In the West, Tang sancai wares were sometimes referred to as egg-and-spinach.\\nSancai wares were northern wares made using white and buff-firing secondary kaolins and fire clays. At kiln sites located at Tongchuan, Neiqiu County in Hebei and Gongyi in Henan, the clays used for burial wares were similar to those used by Tang potters. The burial wares were fired at a lower temperature than contemporaneous whitewares. Tang dynasty tomb figures, such as the well-known representations of camels and horses, were cast in sections, in moulds with the parts luted together using clay slip. They were either painted in sancai or merely coated in white slip, often with paint added over the glaze, which has now mostly been lost. In some cases, a degree of individuality was imparted to the assembled figurines by hand-carving.\\n\\n\\n=== Greenwares or celadon wares ===\\nThe major group of celadon wares is named for its glaze, which uses iron oxide to give a broad spectrum of colours centred on a jade or olive green, but covering browns, cream and light blues. This is a similar range to that of jade, always the most prestigious material in Chinese art, and the broad resemblance accounts for much of the attractiveness of celadon to the Chinese. Celadons are plain or decorated in relief, which may be carved, inscribed or moulded. Sometimes taken by the imperial court, celadons had a more regular market with the scholarly and middle classes, and were also exported in enormous quantities. Important types are: Yue ware, Yaozhou ware and the wider Northern Celadons, Ru ware, Guan ware, and finally Longquan celadon.\\n\\n\\n=== Jian ware ===\\n\\nJian Zhan blackwares, mainly comprising tea wares, were made at kilns located in Jianyang, Fujian province. They reached the peak of their popularity during the Song dynasty. The wares were made using locally won, iron-rich clays and fired in an oxidising atmosphere at temperatures in the region of 1,300 °C (2,370 °F). The glaze was made using clay similar to that used for forming the body, except fluxed with wood-ash. At high temperatures the molten glaze separate to produce a pattern called \"hare\\'s fur\". When Jian wares were set tilted for firing, drips run down the side, creating evidence of liquid glaze pooling.\\nJian tea wares of the Song dynasty were also greatly appreciated and copied in Japan, where they were known as tenmoku wares.\\n\\n\\n=== Jizhou ware ===\\n\\nJizhou ware was stoneware, mostly used for tea drinking. It was famous for glaze effects, including a \"tortoiseshell\" glaze, and the use of real leaves as glaze resists; the leaf burnt away during firing, leaving its outlines in the glaze.\\n\\n\\n=== Ding ware ===\\n\\nDing (Wade–Giles: Ting) ware was produced in Ding County, Hebei Province. Already in production when the Song emperors came to power in 940, Ding ware was the finest porcelain produced in northern China at the time, and was the first to enter the palace for official imperial use. Its paste is white, generally covered with an almost transparent glaze that dripped and collected in \"tears\", (though some Ding ware was glazed a monochrome black or brown, white was the much more common type). Overall, the Ding aesthetic relied more on its elegant shape than ostentatious decoration; designs were understated, either incised or stamped into the clay prior to glazing. Due to the way the dishes were stacked in the kiln, the edged remained unglazed, and had to be rimmed in metal such as gold or silver when used as tableware. Some hundred years later, a Southern Song dynasty writer commented that it was this defect that led to its demise as favoured imperial ware. Since the Song government lost access to these northern kilns when they fled south, it has been argued that Qingbai ware (see below) was viewed as a replacement for Ding.\\nAlthough not as highly ranked as Ru ware, the late Ming dynasty connoisseur Gao Lian awards Ding ware a brief mention in his volume Eight Discourses on the Art of Living. Classified under his sixth discourse, the section on \"pure enjoyment of cultured idleness\", Master Gao said: \"The best sort has marks on it like tear-stains... Great skill and ingenuity is displayed in selecting the forms of the vessels.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Ru ware ===\\n\\nLike Ding ware, Ru ware (Wade–Giles: ju) was produced in North China for imperial use. The Ru kilns were near the Northern Song capital at Kaifeng. In similar fashion to Longquan celadons, Ru pieces have small amounts of iron oxide in their glaze that oxidize and turn greenish when fired in a reducing atmosphere. Ru wares range in colour—from nearly white to a deep robin\\'s egg—and often are covered with reddish-brown crackles. The crackles, or \"crazing\", are caused when the glaze cools and contracts faster than the body, thus having to stretch and ultimately to split, (as seen in the detail at right; see also ). The art historian James Watt comments that the Song dynasty was the first period that viewed crazing as a merit rather than a defect. Moreover, as time went on, the bodies got thinner and thinner, while glazes got thicker, until by the end of the Southern Song the \\'green-glaze\\' was thicker than the body, making it extremely \\'fleshy\\' rather than \\'bony,\\' to use the traditional analogy (see section on Guan ware, below). Too, the glaze tends to drip and pool slightly, leaving it thinner at the top, where the clay peeps through.\\n\\nAs with Ding ware, the Song imperial court lost access to the Ru kilns after it fled Kaifeng when the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty conquered northern China, and settled at Lin\\'an (present-day Hangzhou) in the south. There, the Emperor Gaozong founded the Guan yao (\\'official kilns\\') right outside the new capital in order to produce imitations of Ru ware. However, posterity has remembered Ru ware as something unmatched by later attempts; Master Gao says, \"Compared with Guan yao, the above were of finer substance and more brilliant luster.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Jun ware ===\\n\\nJun (Wade–Giles: chün) ware was a third style of porcelain used at the Northern Song court. Characterized by a thicker body than Ding or Ru ware, Jun is covered with a turquoise and purple glaze, so thick and viscous looking that appears to melting off the golden-brown body. Not only are Jun vessels more thickly potted but their shape is also much more robust than the fine Jun pieces, yet both types were appreciated at the court of Emperor Huizong. Jun production was centred at Jun-tai in Yuzhou, Henan Province.\\n\\n\\n=== Guan ware ===\\n\\nGuan (Wade–Giles: kuan) ware, literally means \"official\" ware; so certain Ru, Jun, and even Ding are Guan in the broad sense of being produced for the court. Usually the term in English only applies to that produced by an official, imperially run kiln, which did not start until the Southern Song dynasty fled from the advancing Jin dynasty and settled at Lin\\'an. During this period walls become very thin, with glaze thicker than the wall. The clay in the foothills around Lin\\'an was a brownish colour, and the glaze very viscous.\\n\\n\\n=== Ge ware ===\\n\\nGe (Wade–Giles: ko), literally \"big-brother\" ware, due to a legend of two brothers working in Longquan, one made the typical celadon style ceramics, the elder made ge ware, produced in his private kiln. Ming dynasty commentator Gao Lian writes that the ge kiln took its clay from the same site as Guan ware, accounting for the difficulty in distinguishing one from the other (though Gao thinks \"Ge is distinctly inferior\" to Guan). Overall, Ge remains somewhat elusive, but basically comprises two types—one with a \\'warm rice-yellow glaze and two sets of crackles, a more prominent set of darker colour interspersed with a finer set of reddish lines\\' (called chin-ssu t\\'ieh-hsien or \\'golden floss and iron threads\\', which can just faintly be detected on this bowl). The other Ge ware is much like Guan ware, with grayish glaze and one set of crackles. Once thought to have only been manufactured alongside Longquan celadon, per its legendary founding, Ge is now believed to have also been produced at Jingdezhen.\\nWhile similar to Guan ware, Ge typically has a grayish-blue glaze that is fully opaque with an almost matte finish. Its crackle pattern is exaggerated, often standing out in bold black. Though still shrouded in mystery, many specialists believe that Ge ware did not develop until the very late Southern Song dynasty or even the Yuan dynasty. In any case, enthusiasm for it persisted throughout the Ming dynasty; Wen Zhenheng preferred it to all other types of porcelain, in particular for brush washers and water droppers (although he preferred jade brush washers to porcelain, Guan and Ge were the best ceramic ones, especially if they have scalloped rims). Differences between later Ming imitations of Song/Yuan Ge include: Ming versions substitute a white porcelain body; they tend to be produced in a range of new shapes, for example those for the scholar\\'s studio; glazes tend to be thinner and more lustrous; and slip is applied to the rim and base to simulate the \"brown mouth and iron foot\" of Guan ware.\\n\\n\\n=== Qingbai wares ===\\n\\nQingbai wares (also called \\'yingqing\\') were made at Jingdezhen and at many other southern kilns from the time of the Northern Song dynasty until they were eclipsed in the 14th century by underglaze-decorated blue and white wares. Qingbai in Chinese literally means \"clear blue-white\". The qingbai glaze is a porcelain glaze, so-called because it was made using pottery stone. The qingbai glaze is clear, but contains iron in small amounts. When applied over a white porcelain body the glaze produces a greenish-blue colour that gives the glaze its name. Some have incised or moulded decorations.\\nThe Song dynasty qingbai bowl illustrated was likely made at the Jingdezhen village of Hutian, which was also the site of the imperial kilns established in 1004. The bowl has incised decoration, possibly representing clouds or the reflection of clouds in the water. The body is white, translucent and has the texture of very-fine sugar, indicating that it was made using crushed and refined pottery stone instead of pottery stone and kaolin. The glaze and the body of the bowl would have been fired together, in a saggar in a large wood-burning dragon kiln, typical of southern kilns in the period.\\nThough many Song and Yuan dynasty qingbai bowls were fired upside down in special segmented saggars, a technique first developed at the Ding kilns in Hebei province. The rims of such wares were left unglazed but were often bound with bands of silver, copper or lead.\\nOne remarkable example of qingbai porcelain is the so-called Fonthill Vase, described in a guide for Fonthill Abbey published in 1823 as \"an oriental china bottle, superbly mounted, said to be the earliest known specimen of porcelain introduced into Europe\".\\nThe vase was made at Jingdezhen, probably around 1300 and was probably sent as a present to Pope Benedict XII by one of the last Yuan emperors of China, in 1338. The mounts referred to in the 1823 description were of enamelled silver-gilt and were added to the vase in Europe in 1381. An 18th-century water colour of the vase complete with its mounts exists, but the mounts themselves were removed and lost in the 19th century. The vase is now in the National Museum of Ireland. It is often held that qingbai wares were not subject to the higher standards and regulations of the other porcelain wares, since they were made for everyday use. They were mass-produced, and received little attention from scholars and antiquarians. The Fonthill Vase, given by a Chinese emperor to a pope, might appear to cast at least some doubt on this view.\\n\\n\\n=== Blue and white wares ===\\n\\nFollowing in the tradition of earlier qingbai porcelains, blue and white wares are glazed using a transparent porcelain glaze. The blue decoration is painted onto the body of the porcelain before glazing, using very finely ground cobalt oxide mixed with water. After the decoration has been applied the pieces are glazed and fired.\\nIt is believed that underglaze blue and white porcelain was first made in the Tang dynasty. Only three complete pieces of Tang blue and white porcelain are known to exist (in Singapore from the Indonesian Belitung shipwreck), but shards dating to the 8th or 9th century have been unearthed at Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province. It has been suggested that the shards originated from a kiln in the province of Henan. In 1957, excavations at the site of a pagoda in Zhejiang province uncovered a Northern Song bowl decorated with underglaze blue and further fragments have since been discovered at the same site. In 1970 a small fragment of a blue and white bowl, again dated to the 11th century, was also excavated in the province of Zhejiang.\\nIn 1975, shards decorated with underglaze blue were excavated at a kiln site in Jiangxi and, in the same year, an underglaze blue and white urn was excavated from a tomb dated to 1319, in the province of Jiangsu. It is of interest to note that a Yuan funerary urn decorated with underglaze blue and underglaze red and dated 1338 is still in the Chinese taste, even though by this time the large-scale production of blue and white porcelain in the Yuan dynasty, Mongol taste had started its influence at Jingdezhen.\\nStarting early in the 14th century, blue and white porcelain rapidly became the main product of Jingdezhen, reaching the height of its technical excellence during the later years of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1661–1722) and continuing in present times to be an important product of the city.\\nThe tea caddy illustrated shows many of the characteristics of blue and white porcelain produced during the Kangxi period. The translucent body showing through the clear glaze is of great whiteness and the cobalt decoration, applied in many layers, has a fine blue hue. The decoration, a sage in a landscape of lakes and mountains with blazed rocks is typical of the period. The piece would have been fired in a saggar (a lidded ceramic box intended to protect the piece from kiln debris, smoke and cinders during firing) in a reducing atmosphere in a wood-burning egg-shaped kiln, at a temperature approaching 1,350 °C (2,460 °F).\\nDistinctive blue-and-white porcelain was exported to Japan, where it is known as Tenkei blue-and-white ware or ko sometsukei. This ware is thought to have been especially ordered by tea masters for the Japanese ceremony.\\n\\n\\n=== Blanc de Chine ===\\n\\nBlanc de Chine is a type of white porcelain made at Dehua in Fujian province. It has been produced from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) to the present day. Large quantities arrived in Europe as Chinese export porcelain in the early 18th century and it was copied at Meissen and elsewhere.\\nThe area along the Fujian coast was traditionally one of the main ceramic exporting centres. Over 180 kiln sites have been identified extending in historical range from the Song dynasty to the present.\\nFrom the Ming dynasty, porcelain objects were manufactured that achieved a fusion of glaze and body traditionally referred to as \"ivory white\" and \"milk white\". The special characteristic of Dehua porcelain is the very small amount of iron oxide in it, allowing it to be fired in an oxidising atmosphere to a warm white or pale ivory colour. (Wood, 2007)\\nThe porcelain body is not very plastic but vessel forms have been made from it. Donnelly, (1969, pp.xi-xii) lists the following types of product: figures, boxes, vases and jars, cups and bowls, fishes, lamps, cup-stands, censers and flowerpots, animals, brush holders, wine and teapots, Buddhist and Taoist figures, secular figures and puppets. There was a large output of figures, especially religious figures, e.g. Guanyin, Maitreya, Lohan and Ta-mo figures.\\n\\nThe numerous Dehua porcelain factories today make figures and tableware in modern styles. During the Cultural Revolution \"Dehua artisans applied their very best skills to produce immaculate statuettes of Mao Zedong and the Communist leaders. Portraits of the stars of the new proletarian opera in their most famous roles were produced on a truly massive scale.\" Mao Zedong figures later fell out of favour but have been revived for foreign collectors.\\nNotable artists in blanc de Chine, such as the late Ming period He Chaozong, signed their creations with their seals. Wares include crisply modeled figures, cups, bowls and joss stick-holders.\\nMany of the best examples of blanc de Chine are found in Japan where the white variety was termed hakugorai or \"Korean white\", a term often found in tea ceremony circles. The British Museum in London has a large number of blanc de Chine pieces, having received as a gift in 1980 the entire collection of P.J. Donnelly.\\n\\n\\n=== Painted colours ===\\n\\nChinese court taste long favoured monochrome wares, and although the Yuan dynasty saw blue and white porcelain accepted by the court, more fully polychrome styles took much longer to be accepted. Initially blue from cobalt was almost the only pigment that could withstand the high temperature of a porcelain firing without discolouring, but gradually (mostly during the Ming period) others were found, or the extra cost of a second firing at a lower temperature to fix overglaze enamels was accepted. Copper-reds could produce highly effective results underglaze, but at the cost of an extremely high proportion of greyish rejects, some of which remain in circulation, and thousands more of which have been found when kiln waste-heaps have been excavated. Eventually underglaze blue and overglaze red became the usual way of achieving the same result.\\nOverglaze painting, usually called \"enamels\", was widely used in the popular Cizhou ware stonewares, and was sometimes experimented with by kilns producing for the court, but not until the 15th century, under the Ming, was the doucai technique used for imperial wares. This combined underglaze blue outlines with overglaze enamels in further colours. The wucai technique was a similar combination, with underglaze blue used more widely for highlights.\\nTwo-colour wares, using underglaze blue and an overglaze colour, usually red, also produced very fine results. A number of different other methods using coloured glazes were tried, often with images lightly incised into the body. The fahua technique outlined areas of coloured decoration with raised trails of slip, and the subtle \"secret\" (an hua) technique decorated using very light incisions that could hardly be seen. As the range of glaze colours expanded, the taste for monochrome wares, now in the new strong colours, returned, and with it a number of special glazing effects were developed, including the return of crackle and spotty effects made by blowing powdered pigment onto the piece.\\n\\n\\n==== Classification by colour, the famille groups ====\\n\\nThe next development saw a group of \\'families\\', or palettes of enamel colours used on Chinese porcelain. These are commonly known by their French names of famille jaune, noire, rose, verte, based on the dominant element in each colour palette are terms used to classify. A large proportion of these were export wares but some were made for the Imperial court.\\n\\nFamille verte (康熙五彩, Kangxi wucai, also 素三彩, susancai, lit. \\'three colours on a plain [unglazed or thinly glazed] body\\'), adopted in the Kangxi period (1661–1722), uses green and iron red with other overglaze colours. It developed from the wucai (五彩, \"five colours\") style.\\n\\'Famille jaune is a variation using famille verte enamels on a yellow ground (黃地), often painted on the biscuit.\\nFamille noire (墨地素三彩, modi susancai) is another subtype of famille verte, but it uses a black ground. Many famille jaune and famille noir pieces were \"clobbered\" with the yellow or black added in the 19th century.\\nFamille rose (known in Chinese as fencai (粉彩 or ruancai (軟彩 / 软彩), lit. \\'soft colours\\' or \\'pale colours\\'), Yangcai (洋彩), lit. \\'foreign colours\\'), and falangcai (珐琅彩, lit. \\'enamel colours\\'), was introduced late in the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1661–1722), possibly around 1720. It used mainly pink or purple and remained popular throughout the 18th and the 19th centuries, also being widely adopted by European factories. Famille rose enamel ware allows a greater range of colour and tone than was previously possible, enabling the depiction of more complex images.\\n\\n\\n== Stoneware ==\\n\\nPottery classified as stoneware in the West is usually regarded as porcelain in Chinese terms, where a stoneware group is not recognised, and so the definition of porcelain is rather different, covering all vitrified high-fired wares. Terms such as \"porcellaneous\" and \"near-porcelain\" are often used to reflect this, and cover wares that in Western terms lie on the border of stoneware and porcelain. High-fired stonewares were numerous from very early on, and included many high-prestige wares, including those for imperial use, as well as great quantities of everyday utilitarian pots. Usually they achieved their reputation by their glazes. Most of the celadon group, including Longquan celadons, especially earlier ones, can be classified as stoneware, and all classic Jian wares and Jizhou wares.\\nBy contrast, the Yixing clay teapots and cups made from Yixing clay from Jiangsu province are usually left unglazed, and not washed after use, as the clay is believed to improve the taste of the tea, especially after it acquires a patina from long use. There are in fact a number of different clays, giving a range of colours. The pots are unusual in that they are often signed by their potters, which is very rare in China, perhaps because they were associated with the literati culture, of which Jiangsu was a stronghold. The earliest datable example is from a burial of 1533 in Nanjing. Elaborately decorated examples, often with a rectangular body, were exported to Europe from the 18th century, and these and pots for local use often had poems inscribed on them. As well as teaware and desk objects such as brush-rests, fruit and other natural shapes were modelled as ornaments. Production continues today, generally using simpler shapes.\\n\\n\\n== The ceramics industry under the Ming ==\\n\\n\\n=== Imperial and private kilns ===\\nThe very first imperial kiln was established in the thirty-fifth year of Hongwu. Before that, there were no systematic regulations on the state-demanded porcelain production. The law stated that, if the quantity of ceramics demanded was big, potters would be conscripted and worked in the imperial kilns in Nanjing; if the quantity was small, the ceramics could be produced in private kilns in Raozhou. In either case, officials from the imperial centre were sent to supervise the production. The officials were responsible for making budgets, ensuring quality, and sending products back to the imperial court. Different rules on styles and sizes of the ceramics were put forward by the imperial court and must be strictly followed in the kilns. After 1403, imperial kilns were built, and carried out the imperial porcelain production on a large scale.\\nDuring the mid-Ming period, the demand for porcelain increased, the temporarily assigned officials were not able to handle the project. In the Xuande period, the imperial factory in Jingdezhen was established. The factory was divided into dormitories and pavilions on the north, official offices, and prisons on the east and workshops on the west. There were wells, wood sheds, temples and lounges for potters. The imperial factory in Jingdezhen was not a mere production site but also included government administrative offices.\\nThe imperial factory was divided into twenty-three departments, with each taking charge of different aspects of ceramics production. The work was subdivided by type and assigned to different departments like department of large vessels, small vessels, painting, carving, calligraphy, rope making and general carpentry. This subdividing of the work so that a single piece of a vessel could pass through several hands led to potters not signing pieces as they did in the private kilns. The division of labour also ensured a uniform style and size in the ceramics.\\nThe number of imperial kilns varies during the Ming period. There were fewer than ten imperial factories in the fifteenth century, then the number increased to 58, later again to 62 and then decreased to 18.\\n\\nImperial orders demanded both individuality in the design of porcelain while also demanding large quantities of it. Understandably, these demands came from different sectors of the court that expected particular designs. For example, yellow and green products decorated with mythical flying creatures were specifically requested by the Directorate for Palace Delicacies. The need for both individual design and mass production was a recipe for exhausting demands on porcelain kilns. Many were forced to outsource their production to private kilns in order to meet court quotas. Those who managed the production at imperial factories understood the need for outsourcing as an answer to scalability. Outsourcing must have required a keen sense in picking private kilns that would deliver quality and quantity. Without cooperation and transparency between colleagues of different kilns, the satisfaction of the imperial court was in jeopardy.\\nIn the late Ming period, the corvée system in ceramics reformed with the strong influence of commercialization. Under the new system, a person would not be conscripted to work if he paid a certain amount of money. Many good potters thus left the imperial kilns and worked in the private ones where the pay was better. The late Ming period witnessed a drastic decline in the quality of pieces from the imperial kilns and a rise of private kilns.\\nThe private kilns existed in the early Ming dynasty and their production constituted a part of the tax income of the government. Apart from making ceramics for people\\'s everyday life, private kilns also accepted orders from the imperial court. However, making and selling imperial style ceramics in private kilns was strictly forbidden.\\nDuring the late Ming period, private kilns rose as imperial kilns declined. Many famous workers escaped from the overworked and underpaid environment in the imperial kilns to private ones. Private kilns were more involved in commercials than the imperial kilns did. In the late Ming period, several private kilns won great popularity among the literati, who were enthusiastic about the antique style porcelain. Examples were the Cui kiln (崔公窑), Zhou kiln (周窑), and Hu kiln (壶公窑). Ceramics in the late Ming dynasty was produced in high quality and quantity, making Jingdezhen one of the earliest commercial centres in the world.\\nCompetition in the porcelain industry erupted following the failure of the corvée system. With government control at a low, investors could invest in many means of production, especially in handicraft industries. In Jingdezhen, over 70 percent of the 100,000 families occupying the 6.5 square kilometre town were involved in the porcelain industry.\\nThe economic resurgence brought on by the porcelain industry carried along its own ramifications. There existed two sides of the porcelain industry which are described as jiating shougongye (家庭手工业, \"family-run industry\") and zuofang shougongye (作坊手工业, \"entrepreneurial industry\"). Family-run industries reveal the ruthless and inhumane side of the porcelain industry as seen in the story of Yang Shi in \"An Injustice Caused by a Slight Dispute Over One Penny\". The story vividly describes a scene of domestic violence as a result of the wife, Yang Shi, purchasing a drink worth a penny to soothe her aching stomach. This story sums up the drama within family-run industries as a result of the cut-throat approach to profits. Especially within work involving relatives or immediate family, one\\'s own self worth and concept will be diminished in the face of success for the business.\\nThe cut-throat mentality served to blur the family hierarchy within family-run industries to some degree. Porcelain production required both the construction of pots as well as the decorations done after. Within a family-run pottery industry, the women took on this decorating role which helped to increase their value to the family. Men and women had to work harmoniously to produce good quality work and ultimately this spread throughout the porcelain industry.\\n\\n\\n=== Life as a potter ===\\nIn the early Ming dynasty, the population could be divided into three categories: military, craftsmen, and peasants. Within the craftsmen system, most of the craftsmen were from the previous dynasty, the Yuan dynasty; others were prisoners or unemployed people. Craftsmen households members had to work throughout their lifetime, and their status was hereditary. There were two subcategories within the craftsmen system: military craftsmen, who were specialized in producing weapons; the ordinary craftsmen, who worked in various other industries. Potters belonged to the latter subcategory.\\nIn the early Ming period, whenever the court demanded ceramics, labor would be conscripted by the court in different ways. Usually, there were different types of workers in the imperial kilns. Most of the potters were selected from the craftsman households by the local government and served in the imperial kilns for three months in every four years for free; in other cases, workers were recruited from counties near the imperial kilns and paid regularly. Usually the recruited workers were assigned to different departments.\\nThe imperial factory was divided into twenty-three departments, with each department having managers and workers. The number of managers was usually less than five, and the number of workers was usually about ten to twenty.\\n\\nMaking porcelain was not easy. More than half the firings of every kiln resulted in spoilt pieces and were thrown away in the neighborhood of Jingdezhen, resulting in a huge dump of porcelain fragments that still exist today. When the kiln was in action, it was important to control the fire, which ideally should produce a constant temperature. The proper choice, preparation, colouring, firing, and the slip should be made on every stage of the production. The regulations on the potters working in the imperial kiln were severe. Potters were punished for delaying, smuggling, producing inferior goods, and other misconducts.\\nOverworked and underpaid, many potters refused or fled from being conscripted into the imperial kilns. By the time of Xuande period, the number of potters escaping from the corvee was about five thousand; in the first year of Jingtai, the number reached about thirty thousand. There was also a great discrepancy in the number of workers in different departments. Sometimes private kiln workers from the corresponding departments would serve as temporary workers in the imperial kilns. To regulate the potters, the government reformed the policy so that the potters would not have to work in the imperial kilns if they pay certain amount of money per month. The new law implied that the potters were no longer tied to the state government. Unable to stand the hard law and the heavy work, many talented workers found their new positions in the private kilns. The imperial kilns suffered from the lost in talented potters and labors, and the quality of the porcelain declined dramatically.\\nStarting from the ninth year of Jiajing, a new policy was carried out. The government prepared their own materials, utilized the private kilns to make porcelain, and paid the private kilns based on the number of porcelain produced. However, the state was usually not able to pay the amount required.\\n\\n\\n=== Post-production ===\\n\\nThe industrialization of Chinese porcelain during the Ming dynasty was not possible without a post-production system that honored scalability as well as scarcity. Individual retail sales were important to kilns but wholesale orders were of even higher importance. In reality, wholesale orders were the backbone of porcelain economics. Without these orders that required months to a year of work to complete, demand would have definitely been lacking.\\nMerchants entered provinces with little knowledge of how porcelain trade was conducted. They relied on brokers to introduce them to reliable kilns and ultimately negotiate prices. Once established, merchants took on negotiating matters. In particular, brokers helped alleviate risk for many kilns by analyzing the integrity of buyers. Due to the guild-esque nature between brokers and kiln owners, guilty knowledge of the buyer\\'s secrets was common talk. If a buyer was deemed as unreliable, word spread throughout the province of such news. Potters claimed the license to know who the bad buyers were. This dangerous knowledge had the ability to ruin a buyer\\'s reputation but on the contrary contributed to the success of kilns.\\nIn observing court orders, porcelain was required for culinary, religious, and display purposes. Since porcelain was often used once and thrown away by the court, imperial orders were at a continuous flow in porcelain factories. Demand was often too high for kilns to meet which hints at the necessity for scalability.\\nFrom their respective kilns, fine porcelain was distributed over sea and land to Southeast Asia, Japan and the Middle East. The magnitude of foreign trade can be understood in a record showing over sixteen million pieces circulating through a Dutch East India Company. The land transportation showed the intensity of labor in the porcelain industry. Dozens of carts sent from Mongolia, Manchuria, Persia and Arabic countries were loaded in the Ming capital full of porcelain and other Chinese goods. Some carts reached thirty feet in height which must have required extreme attention to avoid broken porcelain. Due to the hollowness of porcelain vases, they were filled with soil and beans. The growth of the bean roots helped porcelain withstand further pressure during transportation. In order to effectively transport large amounts of porcelain, as much space in carts must have been used indicated by the thirty foot high carts. Knowing the risk that came with placing fragile porcelain next to and on top of one another, handlers of the porcelain mitigated that risk through the soil and bean method.\\n\\nLike the silk industry, the porcelain industry claimed merit for its mass-producing capabilities. Potters from lower economic backgrounds stuck true to their repetitive methods mostly due to the high risk in attempting new and not tested methods. Trying new techniques could result in the loss of an entire month\\'s worth of work so for these potters, changing their method was not a luxury they could afford. These potters were found in peasant societies outside of Jingdezhen and highlight the particular code that limited their imaginative potential. For potters within Jingdezhen, the code that governed the way their products were created was greatly influenced by international markets. These markets inspired creativity and innovation as seen in how \"Jingdezhen and other pottery centres produced ceramic versions of reliquaries, alms bowls, oil lamps, and stem-cups\" The difference in code did not necessarily contribute to a hierarchical division but rather a diversification in the personality behind Chinese porcelain.\\nForeign trade was not always beneficial for potters because the further away that products had to go from the source (Ex: Jingdezhen) the more vulnerable cargo became. In examining a report of a Spanish voyage, about a fifth of a Chinese ship crew were killed when met by a Spanish voyager of the name Juan de Salcedo. The two ships that were raided held many Chinese valuables including porcelain and most likely were used to trade off the coast of Midoro. Overall, international markets offered great potential for potters seeking greater wealth but unfortunately came with a vulnerability to crime.\\nTrade on an international scale required organization between chiefs and potters. Throughout the Southeast Asian trading ports, chiefs had the power to set port fees as well as control interactions between elite merchants and foreign traders. By possessing the license to impose fees, chiefs were able to profit on almost every transaction within their respective markets and it serves to boost their brilliance in constructing such a diverse market. Potters of luxury porcelain would have to work under the rules set by the chiefs and thus their relationship constructed a hierarchy.\\n\\n\\n== Fakes and reproductions ==\\n\\nChinese potters have a long tradition of borrowing design and decorative features from earlier wares. Whilst ceramics with features thus borrowed might sometimes pose problems of provenance, they would not generally be regarded as either reproductions or fakes. However, fakes and reproductions have also been made at many times during the long history of Chinese ceramics and continue to be made today in ever-increasing numbers.\\nIn addition, the reign marks of earlier emperors (typically from the Ming) were often put on Qing wares, which scholars are often inclined to treat as a mark of respect or aspiration rather than an attempt to deceive, although they clearly did often mislead contemporaries, and confuse understanding.\\n\\nImitations and reproductions of Song dynasty Longquan celadon wares were made at Jingdezhen in the early 18th century, but outright fakes were also made using special clay that were artificially aged by boiling in meat broth, refiring and storage in sewers. Père d\\'Entrecolles records that by this means the wares could be passed off as being hundreds of years old.\\nIn the late 19th century, fakes of Kangxi-period famille noire wares were made that were convincing enough to deceive the experts of the day. Many such pieces may still be seen in museums today, as many pieces of genuine Kangxi porcelain were given additional overglaze decoration in the late nineteenth century with famille noire enamels (a process known as \"clobbering\"). A body of modern expert opinion holds that porcelain decorated with famille noire enamels was not made at all during the Kangxi period, though this view is disputed.\\nA fashion for Kangxi period (1661 to 1722) blue and white wares grew to large proportions in Europe during the later years of the 19th century and triggered the production at Jingdezhen of large quantities of porcelain wares that strike a resemblance to ceramics of earlier periods. Such blue and white wares were not fakes or even convincing reproductions, even though some pieces carried four-character Kangxi reign-marks that continue to cause confusion to this day. Kangxi reign-marks in the form shown in the illustration occur only on wares made towards the end of the 19th century or later, without exception.\\n\\n\\n== Authentication ==\\nThe most widely known test is the thermoluminescence test, or TL test, which is used on some types of ceramic to estimate, roughly, the date of last firing. Thermoluminescence dating is carried out on small samples of pottery drilled or cut from the body of a piece, which can be risky and disfiguring. For this reason, the test is rarely used for dating finely potted, high-fired ceramics. TL testing cannot be used at all on some types of ceramics, particularly high-fired porcelain.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early wares ===\\n\\n\\n=== Han (202 BC to 220 AD) ===\\n\\n\\n===
