Incredibly detailed, the designs demonstrate the sophisticated porcelain enamelling techniques developed during the reign of the Kangxi emperor. A great supporter of the arts, Kangxi initiated major efforts to rebuild the kilns at Jingdezhen, which had been destroyed in 1674 by Minna rebels. The emperor encouraged potters at the newly- rebuilt kilns to push technological limits, resulting in large, finely potted ceramics with complex polychrome designs.  \n\nCommon subjects for such objects include historical characters modelled after illustrations in woodblock- print plays and novels. Literati themes were also popular, such as the scene of scholars enjoying leisurely activities depicted on the brush pot, or the scholarly objects and antiques depicted in panels on the second vase.\n\n# Brush pot  \n\nBrush potJingdezhen, China (Qing dynasty) Kangxi period, 1662–1722Porcelain with underglaze blue and overglaze enamels, height 16.9 cmHKU.C.1972.0431"

The powder blue porcelain vessels have an elegant, undulating profile. The elaborate gilded bronze mounts, which show dragons, were finely sculpted, cast and gilded in France, likely during the reign of Louis XV (1710- 1774). Imported wares were often mounted with extravagant gilt- bronze settings, which adopted the stylistic vocabulary and fantastic forms of French rococo, while also making unfamiliar Chinese forms more useable in European interiors. Merchants called marchands- merciers, who specialised in marketing luxury objects, facilitated the addition of such mountings for the exchange of foreign objects and the creation of new forms of decorativeators.  \n\nThis pair of vessels demonstrates the high regard for fine Chinese porcelain in the European courts. In France, the earliest recorded Chinese (blue and white) ceramic object reached the court of Henry II (1519- 1539) via Constantinople, a gift from Suleiman the Magnificent (1494- 1566). Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Further gifts presented by the Siamese ambassador Phra Narai (1633- 1688) to Louis XIV (1638- 1715) in 1686, and objects imported by the French East India Company (since 1664) helped spread a fashion for such exotica. The intense blue of these Chinese jars may well have been an inspiration for the Sevres blue for which the French royal manufactory became so famous later in the eighteenth century."

The name was first used by collectors in New York, Boston and Philadelphia in the 1930s to refer to their ostentatious detail and subject matter. Late export porcelain of this type was typically made, glazed and fired at Jingdezhen but decorated in Canton, from where it was shipped to Europe and America.  \n\nThese custard cups are part of a larger dinner service of dishes, plates, sauces, platters, tureens, bowls and cups suitable for a grand interior. Each object is decorated with a central scene in the famille roe palette showing different men and women among pavilions and mountainous landscapes. The scenes are surrounded by several painted and gilded borders with geometric and floral patterns, interrupted by small panels showing birds, flowers and landscapes in iron- red or sepia.  \n\nThis design has been referred to as the 'Rockefeller pattern' since 1979, due to its association with the famous Rockefeller family of New York, John D. Rockefeller, Jr (1874- 1946), son and heir of the dynasty's founder, owned a dessert service with the pattern. Prior to being acquired by the Rockefellers, the service was owned and probably commissioned by Charles Stirling, a wealthy Scottish landowner involved in the China trade. Another service of the same design is known to have been ordered by John Roberts (1739- 1810), a Director of the British East India Company, likely around 1805. The gradual dissemination of these services through inheritance and sale accounts for the presence of many individual pieces in different collections today.  \n\nThe famille roe palette used to paint the central scenes was developed in China during the late Kangxi period by Jesuit priests working with craftsmen at the Yangxindian (Hall of Mental Cultivation) within the Forbidden City. It is characterised by soft pinks and reds created by mixing ruby red (derived from colloidal gold) and opaque white enamel, which allowed for a great range of tones and shades. Its development in China was roughly contemporaneous with rose du barry enamels invented in France in the eighteenth century, named after the Comtesse du Barry, mistress to Louis XV (1710- 1774) and a patron of the Sevres porcelain factory.  \n\n![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-07-27/26ec8c02-599c-4b79-9876-e092d6287e02/e8e0efac6fd91feee8f8c4e1f2aa40dce3a11199b0bb8a0cec42982d21d875a6.jpg)"

It has been used to great effect on this bowl to depict mandarin ducks in a lotus pond, framed by a band of stylised, possibly Sanskrit, characters on the rim.  \n\nSince they were mistakenly thought to mate for life, pairs of mandarin ducks are an auspicious symbol for a happy marriage in China. When accompanied by lotuses, homophonous in Chinese with the word for harmony (he), they may also be interpreted as expressing the wish for many sons, and ceramic pairing the two motifs have their origins in the decorative arts of the Tang dynasty. Similar designs were used on Yuan dynasty blue- and- white dishes are enamelled ceramic from the Ming dynasty, as well as kraak wares made for export to Europe. They also appear to have been a popular adornment for Ming jardinières, used as aquaria and to grow water plants.\n\n14.

Established in 1600, the first English East India Company was named The Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies. Formed to pursue trade with maritime Southeast Asia, it eventually came to dominate half of the world's trade. In 1698, its name was changed to the Honourable East India Company and in 1709 a new coat of arms, shown on this plate, was adopted.  \n\nArmorial porcelains like this plate were a major component of the global trade in porcelain for centuries, beginning with blue- and- white dishes made by Jingdezhen for export to Portugal in the 1540s. Britain was a major consumer of armorial porcelain from China, accounting for over half of the total amount of armorial porcelain produced before the entry of America into the China trade in 1784. By the eighteenth century, British porcelain manufacturers were also producing such spades. This plate may have been part of a larger service ordered from the Wode factory by the East India Company in 1822 or 1823, for use in the company's factory in Canton. A banner on the reverse reads \"The London\", after the ship which brought the ceramics to China in 1824. Its captain, John Barnet Sotherby, may have ordered several plates for his own use.  \n\nThe Spode factory developed stone china, a variety of tough earthenware, in 1813. It was one of many similar earthenwares made as substitutes for porcelain after the East India Company responded to the success of the European porcelain industry, and declining demand for Chinese export porcelain, by reducing large- scale imports in 1791."

    "contents": "# Qingbai and celadon  \n\nCenturies before the flowering of blue- and- white wares in the fourteenth century, large kiln sites in northern and southern China were producing glazed porcelain and stoneware in various shades of blue, green and white, which were adorned with elegant incised decoration. Some of the most famous of these include qinghai (green- white), a translucent porcelain with a bluish- green glaze produced at kiln complexes in Jingdezhen and Jizhou, and celadon, a type of porcelain or stoneware with an olive- green glaze that takes its name from a character with a distinctive outfit in L'Astré, a seventeenth- century French comedy. Similar in colour to valuable jade, these ceramics were among the most highly regarded in China—particularly celadon from the Longquan kilns in Lishui, Zhejiang province, which supplied the Southern Song court after the collapse of the northern dynasty in 1127. Today, some scholars prefer the term 'greenware' for these ceramics to avoid using arbitrary Western nomenclature.  \n\nChinese qinghai and celadon wares were also exported to East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Islamic world—where the latter was thought to break or change colour if touched by poison. They were most eagerly collected in regions situated firmly within China's sphere of cultural and political influence, such as Japan. Song dynasty celadon shipped from Ningbo in Zhejiang province to Japan. During the Kamakura period (1185- 1333), celadon became the favoured form of utensils and interior decoration for the Japanese too. Furthermore, and former part of a fashion for karamono (Chinese things), attested to by the thousands of shards recovered from historic sites and many intact examples preserved in major Japanese temples.  \n\nIn Korea, refined Chinese celadon pieces brought to the imperial court by official embassies in the Goryeo period (918- 1392) were seen as the pinnacle of ceramic artistry. Local potters were soon making their own versions, combining stylistic elements drawn directly from Chinese wares as well as new designs articulated for Korean consumers. And in Mainland Southeast Asia, green- glazed ceramics reminiscent of celadon were among the first stonewares to be produced, \n\nusing kiln technologies from China that allowed ceramics to be fired at much higher temperatures. They were made at a number of sites in Vietnam along the Red River Delta during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and most famously at Sawankhalok in the fifteenth century, when they formed one of the early Thai kingdom's most important export commodities.  \n\nCeladon was never sent to Europe in significant numbers, nor were they ever made with Western consumers in mind. The rare examples that did arrive were diplomatic gifts from rulers in the Islamic world, which were sometimes given elaborate mottleshack items. Only three surviving Chinese rattunin pieces can be documented as reaching Europe before 1500: the Fonthill Vase (now in Dublin), which is qingba; a Longquan celadon dish presented to Lorenzo de' Medici by the Mamukh Sultan of Egypt in 1487; and the 'Katzenelnbogen bowl', bought by an aristocratic German pilgrim in the Holy Land in 1433- 1434, who on his return had it given a cover and mount in gilded silver.  \n\nThis absence was most likely the result of changing fashions in Asia. By the time Europe began direct trade with China in the sixteenth century, celadon wares had largely been supplanted in the domestic market by blue- and- white porcelain. Established kilns that had focused on celadon before the fourteenth century turned their attention to the production of blue- and- white wares—although some—such as the kilns in Longquan, Cizhou and Jizhou—continued to produce celadon and other monochromatic ceramics in smaller quantities, and Song examples remained popular among collectors in later periods.  \n\n15. Qinghai is also referred to as yingqing (shadow green), although this name appears only to date from the eighteenth century. Other theories for the origin of celadon suggest that the name is a corruption of 'Saladin', the Ayyubid Sultan, who in 1171 sent forty pieces of the ceramic to the Sultan of Syria, or that it derives from the Sanskrit words sila and dhara, which mean 'green' and 'stone'.

    "contents": "# 青白瓷與青瓷\n\n在十四世纪青花瓷盛行前的数百年，中國北方與南方的大型窯場以製造藍、綠和白色等不同色調的刻花上釉瓷或郊器為主。其中最著名的，包括青白瓷和青瓷。前者是一種產於景德镇和吉州窯的藍線釉半透明瓷器，後者則為一種施橄欖線色釉的的瓷器或郊器，其英文celadon，得名於十七世紀法國葛劇《牧羊女亞絲索萊》中。一名身穿線衣的人物「雪拉同士（Celadon）」色澤近乎翡翠的青白瓷和青瓷，在境內備受推崇，尤其是在一二七年北宋滅亡後，為南宋宮廷供應陶瓷的浙江省麗水市龍泉窯的青瓷。部分當代學者為了更準確地命名這類陶瓷器，會以greenware（線梅陶瓷）來表示青白瓷和青瓷。  \n\n中國青白瓷和青瓷亦是流行的外銷瓷品種，市場遍及東亞、東南亞及伊斯蘭世界。當時的伊斯蘭世界更為若青瓷碰到毒藥，就會裂開或變色。在深受中國文化與政治勢力影響的地區如日本，青瓷受到熱烈追捧。在日本的濂倉時代（1185- 1333），宋代青瓷從浙江省寧波運至日本，成為日本茶道者所喜愛的食具和室內陳設，同時掀起一陣「唐物」風潮——在歷史遺跡所發掘到的碎片、和日本各大寺廟中保存完好的青瓷，則為明證。  \n\n在韓國的高麗皇朝（918- 1392），經外交使飾傳入高麗宮廷的精緻中國青瓷，被視為陶瓷工藝的巅峰之作。高麗的陶匠隨即加以模仿，製作出混合中式風格和高麗本地色彩的青瓷。在東南亞大陸，與青瓷相似的線釉陶瓷是當地首款採用中國燒紫技術，以較高溫燒製而成的炻器。在十三世紀至十四世紀，越南紅河三角洲沿岸設有許多燒造線釉陶瓷的窯場。十五世紀的宋加洛窯是最著名的，其出產的陶瓷更成為泰國早期最重要的出口商品之一。  \n\n只有少量的青瓷外销至欧洲，更鲜有是毒鸟默洲市场而設的。傳入歐洲的罕有例子，是由伊斯蘭世界的統治者所赠的外交禮物，當地人偶會為這些青瓷镶嵌上華麗的金屬。現存有紀錄，於一五零零年前抵達歐洲的中國陶瓷，只有三件，包括「豐山瓶」青白瓷（現藏於都柏林）；由埃及馬木路克蘇丹國的蘇丹，於一四八七年贈予羅倫左·德麥地奇的龍泉烹青瓷碟；及在一四三三至三四年，由德國貴族朝聖先輩從聖地攜回的「卡策內爾恩博根碗」，當時該件青瓷已加蓋、並續有銀飾。  \n\n這段青瓷的「空白期」應該與亞洲的流行風尚有所轉變相關。到了十六世紀，當歐洲直接與中國進行商業貿易後，本地市場上的青瓷已被青花瓷取代。雖然當時部分的烹場，如龍泉烹、磁州烹和吉州烹，仍持續生產少量的青瓷和其他單色釉器，而宋代青瓷仍受往後各朝的古物收藏家所青睐；但大部分在十四世紀前，專注於燒製青瓷的烹場，已轉向生產青花瓷。  \n\n15. 在十八世紀，青白瓷也稱作「影青」。另有理論指出，celadon一字可能是埃有比王朝的蘇丹「薩拉丁」（Saladin）的崑傅，這位薩拉丁於一七一一年，曾下令遷送西什博陶瓷子數利亞的蘇丹。另一說法則認為celadon可能源自梵文 silan 及 dhara，即「綠色」和「石頭」。  \n\n![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-07-27/26ec8c02-599c-4b79-9876-e092d6287e02/4722b2f56cba907391bb8f5198e3b7fcc5b0cf7555dbfccfa5d48f7dca344b3e.jpg)"

Their icy blue- green tinge was produced by applying a glaze with small amounts of iron to a fine porcelain stone and kaolin clay body, which was fired in an oxygen- deprived atmosphere. The colour of their glazes ranged from a very thin and pale white to a pale blue- green that is often associated with celadon. A related form of qinghai with iron oxide seemingly randomly spotted and splashed over vessels was one of the earliest experiments in underglaze decoration. The scrolling floral patterns on these bowls were common decorative forms used on contemporary chinesis and sherifes of the Song dynasty.  \n\nQinghai wares were produced in a variety of forms for the domestic market, including utilitarian bowls, dishes and teapots for daily use and more elaborate figures and jars for burial. Though not generally made for the imperial court, they were appreciated by Song connoisseurs, such as the ceramic historian Jiang Qi who likened qinghai to jade in his Tao ji (Records on Ceramics), written between 1214- 1234. Valuable export items, their popularity with various trading communities in Java is mentioned in Zhao Rugua (1170- 1231) Zhufanzhi (A Description of Barbarian Nations, Records of Foreign People), a thirteenth- century document which describes foreign customs and commodities traded in South East Asia and the Indian Ocean during the Song dynasty."

This saved space in the kiln by allowing for everted vessels to be stacked in a pile, and was essential for mass produced utilitarian and export wares. It also helped to evenly spread the weight of each vessel around the rim, preventing deformation and allowing for more thinly potted bodies.

Imitations of these jars were produced from the Tang period onwards, initially in metal and later in earthenware and stoneware. Few qinghai jars in these shapes are known, though ceramic liudou with other glazes were sometimes produced at kilns in Yaozhou and Ganzhou, the latter including a notable example recovered from the Sinan wreck, a Chinese cargo vessel that sank off the Sinan coast of Korea in 1323 on a voyage to ports in Korea, Japan and presumably Southeast Asia.  \n\nIn the Song dynasty, educated men demonstrated their cultural refinement by collecting objects from the past and publishing catalogues illustrating historical jades and bronzes. Contemporary Song craftsmen responded to this behavior by reproducing antiquarian forms in other materials, often in the form of commissions for wealthy clients. New users adapted the functions of these objects to suit their needs. This jar was most likely used for burning incense as for offering food to deceased ancestors, rather than as an agricultural tool."

Unique to Korea, this technique involves etching the desired motifs onto a dry clay body and filling in the carved space with a black or white slip. In the mid- twelfth century, possibly inspired by contemporary metalworking and lacquer techniques.  \n\nMuch of the symbolism used in Korean art was adapted from the Chinese decorative repertoire as a result of the close cultural ties between the two countries. Many designs used on celadon wares and other decorative objects are associated with Buddhism, Daoism or Confucianism, which at various times were supported by the ruling class and came to permeate social and religious life. The cranes on this bowl would have carried similar associations with cranes in China, which symbolise longevity. The swirling cloud patterns in the background were a common decorative backdrop used to supplement central motifs and are almost identical to patterns found on Goryeo embroidery."

There were two main centres of production: one in the capital, Sukhothai, and a larger complex in Sawankhalok (also called Si Satchanalai) to the north. The earliest celadons from these sites were probably made around 1400, with many examples recovered from the Nanyang and Longquan wrecks, which sunk in the South China Sea around 1380 and 1400 respectively.  \n\nThese wares appear to have been influenced by green- glazed ceramics introduced to China in the fourteenth century via maritime trade and Thai envoys sent to China, who brought celadon wares back with them after providing tribute to the Ming court- although Thai tradition attributes the development of celadon to Chinese refugees who arrived in Thailand after the collapse of the Song dynasty in 1279.  \n\nDemonstrating a range of Chinese, Khmer and Vietnamese influences, celadon wares from Sawankhalok are nevertheless distinctly Thai in their choice of motifs and shapes, with a characteristic soft green tone achieved by applying green glaze over a white slip. They became popular export items in the fifteenth century, as Thai kilns took advantage of disruptions to production in China to send their ceramics to the Indonesian Archipelago, Malay Peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia. Sawankhalok celadon comprises a major part of the cargo of the mid- fifteenth century Royal Nanhai, the wreck of a Siamese junk heading for Java that was carrying over 20,000 ceramic items. They appear to have been the dominant form of Southeast Asian celadon until around 1488, when they were supplanted by Burmese examples."

The overall decoration imitates Chinese familia verte porcelain, with stylised scroll and flower motifs mostly in green.

Inside, a large central medallion with a double vajra (a Buddhist motif that takes the form of a club with a ribbed spherical head) is framed by a string of pearls on the sides. The compact, hard porcelain bowl is more grey than white, with a blue- tinged glaze that contains numerous bubbles.  \n\nBowls of this type were mass- produced at Jingdezhen in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century, a period marked by a sudden outflow of Chinese blue and- white ceramics to Southeast Asia. Several factors contributed to this fluff of activity in during a change in commercial industry which had developed as a response to reduced imperial porcelain production between 1435 and 1461, and the ensuing environment of economic and political stability during the reigns of the Chenghua and Hongzhi emperors.  \n\nSimilar bowls intended for Southeast Asia from this period have been found in shipwrecks off the coast of Indonesia and the Philippines, such as a nearby identical example recovered from a Chinese junk that sunk off the Lena Bowl ca. 1490- 1500, now in the Ambassador and Mrs Charles Muller collection. They were also sent to Persia, where the honeycomb pattern was prominently used on fritware dishes made in Tabriz and other important cultural centres.\n\n9.

    "contents": "# Bowl  \n\nZhangzhou, China (Ming dynasty), late 16th or early 17th century Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter  $11.3cm$  HKUC.1978.0660  \n\nCrudely potted and decorated on the interior with an egret surrounded by flowers, this bowl was probably made in Zhangzhou, an important porcelain production centre and port in the south of Fujian province, or smaller nearby coastal kilns. Characterised by thick porcelain filled with impurities decorate with simple designs, scholars originally called wares of this type Swatow, after an old Dutch transliteration of Shantou, a port in northern Guangdong province that was mistakenly believed to have been the port from which they were shipped. Excavations in the 1990s revealed several major kiln sites in Zhangzhou that produced these wares in the late sixteenth and mid- seventeenth centuries; they are generally now referred to as Zhangzhou wares.  \n\nValued as much as highly- finished Jingdezhen porcelain in parts of Southeast Asia, Zhangzhou wares were primarily made for export to the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. They were also desired by European traders for the high prices they commanded in the intra- Asian trade. They were made in a variety of shapes, though surviving examples from shipwrecks like the Witter Leeuw, a Dutch ship that sank in 1613 near St. Helena, suggest that large dishes, bowls, covered boxes, jars and small plates were the most popular forms.\n\n10. The term Swatow was apparently introduced by antique dealers and collectors, but it is not clear when the use of the term started. Robert Hobson (1872-1941), former keeper of the Asian Department of the British Museum and author of one of the earliest and most important works on these objects, The Wares of the Ming Dynasty (Hobson 1923), did not use the term Swatow, nor did officials of the Dutch East India Company, who instead referred to them as grof (coarse) wares.  \n"

It is decorated with a scene in cobalt blue underglaze depicting a man with a shaved pate standing among pavilions and banana plant leaves. Wearing a water- proof cape, he may be a hunter or outdoorsman. The absence of reign marks and the lively, imprecise painting style are typical of non- imperial blue- and- white porcelain made in private kilns during the so- called 'transitional period' between the collapse of the Ming dynasty and the stabilisation of Qing rule.  \n\nIts roughly potted body is covered in small flaws in the form of glaze blubber mistakes, fries and grit on the surface, the roughness of pores during the field of the bond properly with the clay. Porcelains like this were particularly popular in Japan, where their imperfections were appreciated by practitioners of the tea ceremony, which celebrated an aesthetic of austerity, spontaneity and apparent artlessness known as wahi. By the early seventeenth- century substantial quantities of Chinese ceramics made with obvious surface flaws (described positively as mushikai, worm- eaten in Japanese) began to be made specifically for this market. These wares, termed ko- sometsuk (old blue- and- white) by nineteenth- century Japanese connoisseurs, were produced in forms that included tea bowls, tea pots, water containers, vases, food trays and incense burners.  \n\nThough ko- sometsuk do not appear to have been exported to the West (none have been recovered from the remains of seventeenth- century vessels carrying goods to Europe), they had a profound impact on the form and styles of late Japanese ceramics made in Arita. Arita wares competed with Chinese kilns in the seventeenth century for a share of the European market and inspired the development of innovative decorative designs that combined both Japanese and Chinese designs at various European ceramic factories, such as Worcester and Derby."

The main pattern depicts awkward- looking twin lions with sharp claws playing with ornamental balls. A prominent inscription at the centre reads: Da Ming Jiajing Nian Zhi—Manufactured in the Reign of Jiajing of the Great Ming Dynasty.  \n\nBecause of their weight, large objects like this were particularly difficult to manufacture, often warping during the firing process. By some accounts, they required up to nine days to fire, with frequent misfires. The almost purple colour of the decoration is the result of mixing imported cobalt blue with lead, which from Parishews called chisteria. A mixture of living porcelains, it was generally only used on jardinières reserved for the imperial court, noble families or high- ranking officials.  \n\nAuspicious patterns like the twin lions sporting ornamental balls were popular during the reign of the Jiajing emperor, a result of his interest in Daosum, alchemy and Xiangrui ('auspicious signs'). The rest of the designs in the gardinière are similarly loaded with symbolism: the cloud motifs are variation of the ruyi ('wish- granting wand') design. The grouping of these images represents a common device in Chinese art: the use of homophones to create visual puns. For example, the words for 'lion' and 'things' are both pronounced shi in Chinese. The combination of twin lions and cloud patterns therefore refers to the blessing of shizhi ruyi ('wishes for all things will be granted').  \n\nEuropeans who acquired Chinese porcelain likely had little understanding of this complex visual language, but enjoyed the pleasing colour, exotic subject matter, minute detail and technical achievement of such objects. The unusual creatures and unfamiliar landscapes also undoubtedly contributed to a European vision of the East that found expression in fantastical art movements such as Chinoiserie and Japonisme."

Mass produced from the late Wanli period for export within Asia as well as to Europe, kraak likely takes its name from the Dutch term for Portuguese merchant ships called caracca, which first brought these wares to the West. Early interest in kraak in the Netherlands was stimulated by the Dutch capture of two Portuguese carcass in 1602 and 1604, whose cargoes were filled with thousands of pieces of kraak ware that were later auctioned off. They were widely depicted in early seventeenth- century Dutch paintings, such as still lifes by Floris van Dijck (1575- 1621) and Osias Beert (ca. 1900- 1625).  \n\nStandard shapes for kraak included bowls, cups and dishes, as well as more specifically Western forms like butter dishes, mustard pots, saltc ellars and wine pots. Deep, un- rimmed bowls and dishes were probably based on earlier Chinese porcelain shapes, while Western forms required the use of pewter, wood or silver models, which Dutch East India Company agents in China ordered regularly. Kraak wares could be of low or extremely fine quality, the latter usually the result of orders made by private traders for special clients. Large plates or chargers were among the most expensive items in European inventories, while smaller examples like this plate from the Hatcher cargo (a Chinese junk that sank near Batavia in 1643) were more affordable.\n\n12. While caracca is generally accepted as the root of kraak, other origins have also been proposed, such as the Dutch verb kraken, which means 'to break'.  "

    "contents": "# Klapmut's bowl  \n\nJingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), early 17th century Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter 15 cm HKU.C.1966.0301  \n\nThe central scene on this bowl features an eagle standing on a rock surrounded by trees. Imagery like this is common in Chinese art, much of it drawn from the bird- and- flower painting genre that developed in the Song dynasty, and which found later expression on ceramics and other materials. Associated with boldness, strength and heroism, the eagle shown on a rock may represent a hero standing alone, a subject known on a number of earlier sixteenth- century export wares made at the Zhangzhou kilns in Fujian for export to Southeast Asia.  \n\nThe central image is surrounded by a reserve panel pattern typical of kraak porcelain. Alternative panels contain leaves shaped forms with a variety of auspicious symbols, such as a double gourd (representative of good fortune), leaf (felicity), peach (immortality) and pomegranate (fertility). Above the lozenges are triangular fields showing animal faces. Unlike typical panelled borders found on kraak, each element is unique and none are repeated.  \n\nDeep bowls with flattened rims were a characteristic export shape. Designed as soup bowls, the wide rim was intended to accommodate large metal spoons that were not used in China. Many examples were made for the Dutch marks, often called klapmuts—the Dutch word for fashionable seventeenth- century hats of the same shape. Klapmut's bowls appear extensively in Dutch East India Company shipping records, as well as in paintings, the earliest dating to 1601."

It combines the panelled borders of kraak porcelain with loosely painted motifs in the transitional style. The border is divided into segments of floral decoration alternating with robed figures seated in rocky landscapes. They surround a central image of two figures in a garden filled with rockwork, foliage and cloud scrolls. Based on Chinese prototypes, the Dutch painter has simplified the design so much that the figures appear almost cartoon- like.  \n\nAlthough Europeans failed to produce hard- paste porcelain until the eighteenth century, there were numerous attempts to make earthenware imitations from an early stage. The practice of coating buff- coloured pottery with clear lead glaze mixed with tin oxide to create a white surface was most likely introduced to Europe from the Islamic world via Moorish Spain. It was practiced at numerous centres, where it came to be known by different names—Delft in Holland, delftware in England, faience in France, and Germany and maolicia in Italy. Dutch examples painted with decoration imitating blue- and- white Chinese porcelains were first produced in Haarlem in North Holland, where potters from Flanders settled after the fall of Antwerp in 1585."

The design in each quarter of the outer band is repeated and separated by floral bouquets, except for an area that was intentionally left blank so that it could be personalised to suit individual buyers. That space was painted with a coat of arms in red, orange and green enamels—probably the arms of a member of the Knights of Malta. The design sought for personalised details like this were specially commissioned drawings incorporating the arms and insignia of the client.  \n\nThe quest to duplicate Chinese porcelain was an obsession shared by many connoisseurs and entrepreneurs in Europe. Early successes in Florence commissioned by Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici (r. 1574- 1587) led to the production of a type of soft- paste porcelain made from white clay and ground glass around 1575. Italian potters also attempted to imitate Chinese porcelain by applying painted decoration to traditional low- fired earthenwares with a white tin glaze called maiolica. Italian maiolica production flourished from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries and laid the foundations for other tin- glazed pottery traditions in Europe.\n\n"

Because of their rarity and cost, these early mounted porcelains were confined to royalty and a few aristocratic families, where they were used as attractive sideboards or displayed in kunstkammer (cabinets of curiosities in German).  \n\nAfter the Dutch and British East India companies entered the trade in Chinese ceramics in the seventeenth century, and porcelain became available to a growing middle- class, the practice of mounting these objects with precious metals continued as a means of demonstrating wealth and luxury. Their presence in numerous Dutch and Flemish still life paintings of the early seventeenth century attests to their popularity.  \n\nMounted porcelain took various forms, from small blue- and- white bowls and ewers to large celadon vases and pots. This bowl was made for export at Jingdezhen, with the mounts added later, probably in the Netherlands. The exterior features an openwork honeycomb and flower- head pattern, revealing a body decorated with underglaze blue floral sprays beneath. Double- walled objects with a pierced outer wall like this bowl are called linglong (devil's work') in China due to the time and effort it takes to produce them."

Depictions of qilin were relatively rare before the seventeenth century, but became more popular during the reign of the Shunzhi emperor. They were usually depicted with the head of a dragon, the body of a deer (but scaled), the hooves of a goat and the tail of a Buddhist lion- dog. The treatment of the banana plant to the right of the qilin is consistent with those found on other blue- and- white wares dated to the mid- seventeenth century, such as an almost identical plate from the Gerald Reitlinger collection of the Ashmolean Museum (acc. no. 1778.888), and a number of fragments in the Metropolitan Museum of Art that were recovered from the wreck of the Nuestra Señora de la Maravilla, a Spanish treasure galleon sunk in 1950.  \n\nThe glazed base is incised with the four- character mark of yutang jiaqi (fine vessel for the jade hall).

But few of the craftsmen who decorated these objects had ever been to China, and their imaginations resulted in landscapes, people and animals that audiences in China would have barely recognised, such as the pagodas and trees depicted with hatched and cross- hatched lines on this bowl. Combining Asian motifs with Western embellishments, the twisted handles with moulding leaf appliques were inspired by contemporary rococo designs on ceramics and metalwares. The bowl is made of leaf fabric, a greyish earthenware with a blue- golden background, and a gold- colored finish on the sides of the bowl."

Made by adding high concentrations of iron oxide (usually in the form of iron filings) to the glaze during the firing process, porcelain wares of this type were referred to as Batavian ware, after the major Dutch port in Indonesia through which they were shipped.  \n\nA visitor to the Qing court, the French Jesuit priest Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles described porcelains of this type as tse- kin (golden brown) in letters sent to his superiors in 1712 and 1723. He observed that they were on the main wares manufactured for the Qing court on a regular basis, and a recent invention—though the long history of brown glazes in China suggests that he was referring specifically to technical processes used in the early eighteenth century rather than brown- glazed porcelain in general.  \n\nThese wares were particularly popular in the Netherlands, although significant quantities recovered from the foundered Swedish East Indiaman Gothervg (sunk 1745) demonstrate that they were also exported to Northern Europe in large quantities. They were shipped to America after it entered the China trade in 1784, and the decoration was later revived in the early nineteenth century, primarily on wares intended for export to Southeast Asia. This bowl was recovered from the Nanking cargo, the wreck of a Dutch East India Company ship which left Canton in December 1751 with more than 230,000 pieces of porcelain, textiles and tea for the European market."

Alongside a reign mark attributing its production to the forty- first year of the Qianlong emperor's reign, a carved inscription on the foot identifies its subject as cong wayi Raren—the wife of an imperial official. The rest of the text provides her name, Zou, and nickname (Jügw, 'lady of chrysanthemum') from which the dish presumably takes its shape. This is followed by a detailed account of her family background. Raren was the title granted for the mothers and wives of imperial officials of the seventh rank and higher during the Ming and Qing dynasties.  \n\nTraditional epitaphs were often carved on stones or ceramics. They describe the experiences, merits and accomplishments of the deceased and were marked reserved for imperial officials and their family members. The eulogy on this bowl associates Zou with many of the feminine virtues in dynastic China, such as the Confucian triad of obedience as a daughter, wife and mother. Both 'willow' and 'stay' are pronounced liu in Chinese, and the presence of the willow at the centre of the bowl was likely an expression of yearning for Zou from her family."

Fujian, a tea- growing region, attracted the attention of European merchants in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and many of these objects were brought back to Europe, where this type of white Dehua porcelain became known as blanc de Chine (French for 'white of China'). They were also exported to Japan in large quantities.  \n\nDehua specialised in whitewares, the most highly prized were those with an ivory- coloured glaze. References in seventeenth century literary sources note that the translucent appearance of Dehua whitewares was the result of 'truly fine' porcelain stone that was dug by driving a shaft into the side of a nearby hill, from where the material was then pulled out with a rope. The earliest pieces of Dehua porcelain were made of this locally mined porcelain stone, with little or no clay, and were thinly potted. Unlike Jingdezhen, the Dehua kilns had no access to water transportation and until the arrival of foreign merchants most of its products were sold locally.  \n\nThe most common types of Dehua products were incense burners and Buddhist figures moulded and finished by hand. In China, these were usually placed on household altars and the latter were worshipped as devotional images. They were also brought to Europe as exotic curiosity items during the seventeenth century, where they were placed on tables and cabinets in the residences of aristocrats and wealthy people, or exhibited in porcelain rooms.  \n\nBy the eighteenth century, Europeans were familiar with Chinese polychrome ceramics. Dehua wares simply may have been seen as too plain by comparison, and many were gilded or enamelled in Europe to make them more attractive to customers. The Dehua kilns also produced objects tailored for the European market, including figures of Dutch men and women and Christian figures. These wares were closely copied at European porcelain factories, such as Meissen, Chantilly and Bow.  "

Her body is dressed in loosely fitting robes that fall open at the chest, revealing a lotus- shaped pendant and leaving only her right foot uncovered. The head, slightly lowered, bears a jewelled crown placed on neatly arranged hair in a high chignon, all covered by a cowl. Moulded in different sections, the exterior is fully covered by a white glaze with a slightly blueish hue, leaving only the base rim and the interior uncovered.  \n\nGuanyin, the bodhisattva of compassion, is one of the most popular Buddhist figures in China. She originated in India as the male bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, who was transformed after the introduction of Buddhism into China (through a process that is not well understood) into a female bodhisattva associated with the virtues of compassion and mercy. Guanyin was also worshipped as the patron of fishermen, and by women as a fertility goddess and 'bringer of sons'.  \n\nEarly images of a cowled female bodhisattva, dating from the Song dynasty, have been found at the ancient Buddhist cave shrines of Maijishan (cave 165), Gansu province and Dazu (cave 136) in Chongqing. From the seventeenth century onwards, the porcelain kilns at Dehua were celebrated for their production of Buddhist models, amongst which Guanyin figures were prominent. They appear to have been the most popular figural subjects during the reign of the Wanli emperor through to the end of the Qing dynasty."

    "contents": "# Enamelled porcelain  \n\nThe decoration of ceramics with colourful patterns in China started with sancai or 'three- colour' wares from the Tang period. During the late Ming and Qing dynasties, when the trade in porcelain between China and the West reached new heights, porcelains decorated in red, green and yellow with outlines of blackish cobalt or underglaze blue called wucai (five- colour) became the most widely produced polychrome wares. Depending on the prominence of certain colours, they came to be known in Europe by names such as famille verte ('green family') and famille rose ('rose family'), after terms used by the French Jesuit and ceramic collector Albert Jacquemart in 1873.  \n\nColours were added to porcelain by applying enamels (powdered glass mixed with pigments) to unglazed clay that had been through one firing or to glazed ceramics, sometimes with underglaze decoration in blue applied beforehand. The enamels were then fused to the surface through a second firing at a relatively low temperature of about  $900^{\\circ}C$ . Major advancements in the production of polychrome porcelain were achieved in the early eighteenth century, driven by the support of the Kangxi emperor—a patron of the arts who encouraged experimentation at the imperial kilns in Jingdezhen—and by the arrival of European Jesuits at court, who brought with them knowledge of Western chemistry. These innovations included the use of a greater percentage of kaolin in the firing process, the noble uses of chalting in new colour kilns rich and white, and changes to the composition and firing of glazes that led to the invention of complex hues like 'peachbloom' and 'oxblood red'.  \n\nEnamelled porcelain proved hugely successful in Europe, and large amounts were purchased by the Dutch and British East India companies in the seventeenth century. This trade was briefly interrupted when the Qing dynasty cut off porcelain exports from 1644 to 1684, at which point traders turned to the Arita kilns in Japan. The brightly coloured objects they purchased from there were popular enough that Chinese makers were forced to imitate Japanese styles when Chinese exports resumed. European manufactories later produced their own synthesised versions, incorporating stylistic features found on export ceramics from both countries. Facing strong competition from China and Japan, they developed a wide range of goods aimed at different classes, from fine ornamental pieces for the fashion- conscious, to simply decorated items for daily use.  \n\nEnamelled porcelain tended to be more expensive than blue- and- white porcelain, which could be produced in a single firing, and also tended to be more expensive. It was seen as particularly suitable for special commissions with personalised decoration, such as coats of arms, and could replicate designs better than blue- and- white porcelain. It was an interest in these ceramic很少 porcelain such as ones such as the demand for enamelled porcelains in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  \n\nMany different types of enamelled porcelain were also produced for export to parts of Asia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where colourful and boldly patterned ceramics like Zhangzhou ware had been traded since the late Ming dynasty. Some were decorated with unique palettes and motifs not found on ceramics for other markets, such as the vividly contrasting colours and Hindu- Buddhist iconography of 'Bencharong' (derived from the Sanskrit word for 'five- colour') for the Siamese court, or the auspicious symbolism and bright pinks, greens and yellows of 'nyonya ware' made for Peranakan Chinese communities in the Straits Settlements.

First developed during the reign of the Jiajing emperor, the production of wucai porcelain flourished in the Wanli period. These emperors commissioned a variety of porcelain objects decorated in this style, made in both the imperial kilns and private commercial enterprises. These plates, decorated on the interior with an imperial five- clawed dragon and marked on the base with the reign marks of the Wanli emperor, may be one such example.  \n\nDespite the name, wucai porcelain could be decorated with fewer or more than five colours. Ming dynasty enamelling techniques allowed for some variety in tone, but gradations in colour and shading were limited. Innovations in the Kangsi period, such as the addition of opaque white (derived from lead arsenate) and transparent ruby enamel (from colloidal gold), led to the development of new variations of wucai, such as famille rose, which were highly prized in Europe."

    "contents": "# Pair of ko-akae plates  \n\nChina (Ming dynasty), Tianqi period, 1621- 1627 Porcelain with overglaze enamels, width 18.5 cm HKU.C.1978.0627  \n\nPainted in a wuxai palette of red, green, brown and yellow overglaze enamels the scenes on these plates show a Buddhist monk seated on the ground surrounded by tea utensils. The figure may be Kanaka Bharadvaja, iuohan (perfected being, rakan in Japanese), who in Buddhist art is commonly depicted with a book and a fly whisk. Called ko- akae (old red wares) in Japan, they are the colourful equivalents of ko- sometsuke dishes made in China in the seventeenth century for use in meals accompanying the Japanese tea ceremony.  \n\nThe plates feature characteristic surface flaws that tea practitioners found appealing, such as glaze bubbles and worn edges. But the protective brown enamel on the rims and greater regularity and delicacy of shape when compared to many ko- sometsuke speak to the complex aesthetic of the tea ceremony—which was defined as much by individual practitioners as the sensibility of austerity, spontaneity and apparent artlessness promoted by influential masters like Saoung Rikyū (1522- 1591). Though marked on the back with the marks of the Daoguang emperor, such wares were produced during a relatively brief period between the reigns of the Tianqi and Kangxi emperor. These reign marks were probably added later to increase the prestige of the objects or as a mark of respect.  \n\nOther names for ko- akae include Tenkei akae, based on their prolific production during the reign of the Tianqi emperor (called Tenkei in Japanese), and Nankou akae, due to the Japanese belief that they were decorated in Nanjing. They were rarely exported to Europe, where more highly finished and thinly bodied polychrome ceramics were preferred.\n\n13. In Chinese art, luohans are often represented both collectively or as individuals, but in Japanese art they are more commonly represented singly.  "

Wares decorated in several shades of green were particularly prized at the imperial court in Beijing. Their smooth, clear glazes and sophisticated decoration also found wide appeal in the courts of Europe in the seventeenth century. This bowl is decorated with a well- known design from that period, showing horses, flowers and auspicious emblems against a green background of swirling waves.  \n\nThe crests of the waves and some of the horses have been intentionally left without enamel, revealing the white body of the porcelain below.  \n\nPorcelain with predominantly green and yellow designs came to be known as famille verte in the West in the late nineteenth century. Auction records and inventories of the time are littered with references to vases, figures and animals decorated in these colours, and the collector and academic Robert Hobson attested to their popularity in his early catalogues of Chinese ceramic in the British Museum. Major antiquarians of this era, including George Salting, Ernest Grandjier and Anthony de Rothschild, are known to have amassed significant quantities for their private collections."

Highly prized by the upper echelons of Chinese society, they were popular exports to Southeast Asia, Korea, Japan, India and the Middle East, and have been recovered from excavations as far afield as Kenya. They were made in a variety of forms to suit different tastes: from monochrome, blue- and- white and overglaze painted examples, to elaborately gilded works on precious silver.  \n\nThe earliest surviving porcelain yuhuchun are monochrome wares that date the Song dynasty. These porcelain wares were to have been particularly well received in Japan, where they were favoured by tea masters. They were also among the first Chinese porcelains to arrive in the West in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, presented as rare gifts to the ruling houses of Europe via intermediaries in the Middle East. Yuhuchun decorated with cobalt blue were not produced until the Yuan dynasty, when the reopening of overland trade routes between China and Central Asia allowed Chinese potters to import high- quality cobalt more easily.  \n\nMade on a larger scale than earlier examples, blue- and- white yuhuchun were sometimes made in faceted shapes, reflecting different approaches in the Yuan dynasty to the properties of clay as an expressive medium. While Song yuhuchun were mostly thrown on the potter's wheel and allowed to grow naturally into shapes with minimal guidance from the potter's hands, Yuan examples make greater use of the plastic quality of the clay in modelling and moulding. They were often decorated with imagery inspired by designs found on objects from the Islamic world, such as the patterns resembling Islamic calligraphy on this bottle.\n\n5. See a bronze bottle with incised chrysanthemum sprays in place of the panelled designs on this example, recovered from the Sinan shipwreck of 1323 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).  \n\n6. For the latter, see a Song yuhuchun in the Far Eastern Ceramics Museum, Japan, illustrated in Hobson et al. 1931, pp. 136-137.  \n\n7. A yuhuchun named the Fonthill Vase for its previous owner William Beckford of Fonthill Abbey (who acquired it on one of his trips to Paris in 1793, 1803 or 1814) is one of the earliest recorded Chinese porcelain vessels to have been exported to the office of the National Library of Great value, it was once mounted as a ewer in silver-gilt for Ladisdas the Great of Hungary (r. 1342-1382), who gave it to Charles III of Durazzo in 1381 on his ascent to the throne of Naples, and is depicted as such in a watercolour drawing by the French antiquarian Roger de Gaignières, ca. 1713, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.

On wares like this, specially shaped resists were used to create blank areas, which were subsequently painted in overglaze enamels and then fired a second time. A third firing fixed gilded designs onto the surface of the blue ground.  \n\nThe complex three- stage decoration and firing of such objects made them luxurious and expensive export items. They were often decorated with figure and objects that European consumers found appealing, such as a slender Chinese lady depicted in several panels on the vase. In the Dutch language she was called Lange Lijs, which became 'Long Eliza' in English. One of the most popular designs on export wares from the Kangxi period, the design was widely imitated in European porcelain, particularly on plates and bowls from Worcester in the 1760s."

The text displays the poem A Visit to the Red Cliffs at Night by the Ming dynasty official Luo Hongxian, (1504- 1564). A cartographer and scholar Luo's interest in topography and the Chinese landscape is well expressed in his poem, which was written in response to the Ode to the Red Cliffs by the Northern Song scholar Su Shi (1037- 1101). Luo wrote that he visited the Red Cliffs five hundred years after Su Shi, and that the scenery was as beautiful as it was in the past. He described his attempts to retrace Su Shi's footsteps, and the sight of fishermen who came to sell fish in a silent landscape with lonely cranes flying above a river. Painted scenes accompany the poem, showing the cranes and cranes in a clear.  \n\nPowder blue porcelains with gilded decoration were exported to Europe, but the inscriptions, shape and painted scenes on this brush pot suggest that it was made for a Chinese audience—one interested in and familiar with the scholastic named and the literati community they represented."

    "contents": "# Foreword  \n\nThe early modern era was marked by the extension of the Silk Road to Italy and by the beginning of the importation into Europe of Eastern goods in the fourteenth century. Porcelain from China—the first country in the world to produce high- fired, glazed ceramics—was one of the most important elements of this trade, which in the sixteenth century had expanded to include vast quantities of tea, silk, lacquer, spices and opium.  \n\nThis catalogue and its accompanying exhibition tell the story of this trade, exploring how ceramics from different regions, particularly China and Europe, spread styles, forms and manufacturing technologies across the globe, and in the process dramatically altered the course of European and Asian art.  \n\nWhile we place particular importance on early Ming dynasty blue- and- white porcelain pieces that reached the Ducal court of the Medicis in Florence, and early export goods in the Low Countries, our chronological display begins much earlier, with a rare Tang dynasty blue- and- white water pot and a Yuan dynasty bottle—both from time periods that predate better- known Ming production. These ceramics highlight the artistic quality and beauty of Chinese wares, as well as their influence, appreciation and imitation abroad.  \n\nThis international theme is further explored by presenting Ming and Qing dynasty objects that were made for local consumption in China, as well as for export alongside local responses to these wares in Europe, East Asia and Southeast Asia. In so doing, we move beyond the better- known influences of export to the West by including regional varieties of, for example, celadon ware in Korea and Thailand.  \n\nWe would like to thank our exhibition partners, the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Hong Kong Maritime Museum for their generous loans, and for their assistance in organising related public programming and publications. As with all UMAG exhibitions, our mission is to engage with audiences through the discussion of materials and techniques, as well as historic and cross- cultural exchanges. We express our gratitude to Robert Black College, The University of Hong Kong, for support of the exhibition on their 50th anniversary.  \n\nFlorian Knothe  Director, University Museum and Art Gallery.

    "contents": "# Chinese porcelain in Europe and Asia  \n\nThe word porcelain originated with the Venetian traveller Marco Polo (1254- 1324) when he saw white- bodied ceramics being made in China for the court of Kublai Khan. He called them porcelain, Italian for a white seashell, and this soon became the standard term in Europe. But China had been producing porcelain of the highest quality for markets across the globe long before the arrival of Europeans. From the sixth to twentieth centuries, Chinese kilns produced everything from magnificent display pieces for the imperial court to vast quantities of bowls, plates and dishes inter- de- for everyday use and for export to Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The appeal of these works lay not just in their technical achievement, but also in their association with Chinese art and culture, long viewed as a source of learning, tradition and vast wealth.  \n\nThe first Chinese porcelains arrived in Europe in the fourteenth century, when small numbers were presented as rare gifts to the ruling houses of Europe via intermediaries in the Middle East (fig. 1). Delicate, nearly transparent and resistant to extreme heat and moisture, they were technologically superior to the thick, low- fired European ceramics made before the eighteenth century, and were regarded as objects of great rarity and luxury. Their construction was so poorly understood that European collectors often had them mounted in gilt silver or gold in a manner similar to naturalia (natural wonders) like ostrich eggs and large shells, which emphasised their preciousness and transformed them into entirely different objects. They were often displayed in cabinets of curiosities: collections of extraordinary objects which, like today's museums, attempted to categorise and tell stories about the wonders of the natural world (fig. 2).  \n\nBy the early sixteenth century—after Portugal established trade routes to the Far East and began commercial trade with Asia via Portuguese- controlled ports in Macau, Malacca and Dejima—porcelain became an important component of the wider trade in silk, spices, tea, ivory, metalwork and lacquer between East and West. Major production centres like Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province responded to demand in Europe by producing large amounts of porcelain specifically for export, transported and used as a form of ballast in large merchant ships. New arrivals like the Dutch and British built up competing trade networks in the seventeenth century, which stimulated the production of special shapes and patterns for certain countries, as well as commissions from wealthy families who wanted personalised features on their dishes. The fashion for collecting these objects spread so quickly as to appear almost contagious, and was described by some enthusiasts as la maladie die porcelainine—'porcelain- sickness'. Among the wealthiest collectors this led to the creation of 'porcelain rooms', where masses of porcelain wares were displayed together and arranged on mantelpieces, cabinets and fitted wall- mounts—part of the late Baroque interior which combined the lavish use of colour with wood panelled or lacquered walls.  \n\n1. Architect and designer Daniel Marot (1661-1752) is often linked to this late Baroque style. His designs for several rooms of Kensington Palace demonstrate the typical high-density approach to porcelain display of the late Baroque period (ca. 1660-1725).  \n\nThe appearance of these objects changed in step with tastes in Europe. At times consumers favoured designs that depicted an exotic East, while at others Western patterns with prominent armorial crests or landscapes and figures taken from prints were preferred. European designs were transmitted via a well- established trading network which carried models to China, where they were copied onto special services (fig. 3). This often had strange results, such as a Dutch charger with the use of A- arts technical school's AMSTEL DAM's copper exhibition cover with the seal of Portugal painted upside down (fig. 4). Europeans also affected artistic change by bringing new technologies and techniques to China, such as the famille- rose (rose family in French) palette, which was employed widely on both domestic and export porcelain. Guiseppe Castiglione (1688- 1766), a Jesuit painter patronised by the Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors, famously introduced Western painting techniques such as single- point perspective to Chinese artists, which found expression across a variety of mediums.  \n\nLike all successful inventions, Chinese ceramics inspired competition, at first in Asia and later in Europe. In the late Tang period, traders from the Middle East brought Chinese porcelains to western Asia, where potters in Iraq copied them with great ingenuity. Lacking access to naturally occurring kaolin clay—a mineral rich in silicates that gives porcelain much of its strength—they emulated the beauty of pure white porcelain using white slip (a liquefied suspension of clay particles in water), often embellished with painted decoration in blue pigments derived from cobalt oxide (fig. 5). Following the introduction of Chinese examples towards the end of the Tran dynasty (1225- 1400), Vietnamese potters developed their own unique ceramics, which were more heavily potted than Chinese wares and slightly off- white in colour (fig. 6). Produced at major kiln sites like Chu Dou and Bát Tràng near Hanoi, these wares benefited from the first of several interruptions to porcelain production in China, brought about by social unrest and dynastic change, and by the fifteenth century formed part of a lively intra- Asian trade in ceramics with Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.  \n\n2. Referred to as the 'Ming gap' (ca. 1370- 1570) by scholars like Roxanna Brown, these interruptions occurred between 1325 and 1380. The second severe shortage of blue-and-white porcelain saw China's market share of ceramic production decrease to  $50\\%$  from 1368 to 1424-1430. This decreased to  $5\\%$  from 1424-1430 to 1487, before rebounding during the reign of the Hongzhi emperor, and then declining once again until the formal rescinding of the haijin (sea ban) in 1567.  \n\nOn China's borders, nearly five centuries of Goryeo dynasty (918- 1392) rule in Korea saw blue- green celadons inspired by wares from China become the dominant type of ceramics produced on the peninsula. And Korean potters, many of whom arrived during two invasions of Korea led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the 1590s, took an active role in the development of porcelain production in Japan. The early porcelain wares they produced, called Imari after a port near kilns in Arita, had a coarse, grainy texture with fluid, free- form designs in various shades of blue. They were influenced by both Korean and Chinese monochrome porcelain and less formal blue- and white wares from southern Chinese kilns—the latter export wares that were made to conform to the aesthetic of the Japanese tea ceremony. Later, Imari wares were consciously designed to cater to Western tastes and became much more colourful and regimented, at times achieving more access in Europe than their Chinese counterparts.\n\n3. The Dutch, exempt from restrictions on trade placed on other European nations by the Japanese authorities, also spread the Arita potters to Chinese underglaze blue porcelain, which was popular in Europe, so that they could use it as an example in their own work.

    "contents": "# 歐洲奥亞洲的中國瓷器  \n\n瓷器的英文porcelain一字源於意大利語porcelanna（即「白色貝」），為威尼斯旅人馬可·波羅（1254- 1324）對在忽必烈的宮廷所遇見的中國製素白瓷器的稱謂，其後它更成為歐洲的標準用語。但早在歐洲人來華前，中國已為全球市場生產最優質的瓷器。從六世紀至二十世紀，中國各地的窯產量豐富，從華麗的宮廷陳設瓷，到碗、碟等日用瓷，出口至東南亞、日本、韓國及伊斯蘭世界的外銷瓷，應有盡有。瓷器引人入勝之處，不僅是其精湛的工藝，更是它與一直被視為學問、傳統及財質的巨大來源——中國藝術與文化的聯繫。  \n\n直至十四世紀，少量的中國瓷器才首次經中東商旅路足歐洲，作為創終歐洲統治者的珍禮禮物（圖1）。精緻、近乎透明、極為耐熱及耐潮的中國瓷器，在工藝技術上較十八世紀以前，以低溫燒製且厚重的歐洲陶瓷更為優越，故它被視為極罕有的奢侈品。由於歐洲收藏家未能領悟陶瓷之法，故他們偶爾會為瓷器釀嵌金銀裝飾，就像對待駝鳥蛋及大型貝殼等「自然界的食物具物」一樣，以突顯其稀有性，並將之轉化成截然不同的器物。這種擺滿奇珍異品的「珍奇屋」展示方式，就如今天的博物館一樣，嘗試透過分類藏品來訴說大自然奇妙的故事（圖2）。  \n\n十六世紀初，隨著葡萄牙建立來往遠東的貿易航線，並開始經受控的港口，包括澳門、馬六甲及出島與亞洲進行商貿後，瓷器成為東西大規模貿易，包括絲綢、香料、茶葉、象牙、金屬器及漆器的關鍵商品。為配合歐洲市場的需求，主要製瓷中心如江西景德鎮遂大量生產外銷瓷。於運輸過程中，瓷器亦用作大型商船的  壓艙物。到了十七世紀，荷蘭及英國等地相繼建立具競爭性的貿易網絡，進一步刺激了為個別國家訂造特定器型及花紋、及專為富裕家庭而設的個人化碟子的生產。收藏瓷器的風尚席捲歐洲，此風氣被某些極為熱衷者稱為「瓷器狂熱」（as la maladie die porcelaine）。當中最富裕的收藏家更因此成立「瓷器陳列室」，於壁壚、櫞櫃、壁上展示大量的瓷器，配襯髹以色澤奢華的木板或漆器而造的牆壁，作為晚期巴洛克風格室內設計的一部分。  \n\n1. 人們經常將建築師及設計師丹尼爾·馬洛（1661-1752）與晚期巴洛克風格相提並論。肯辛頓宮內由他設計的幾間房間，盪顯巴洛克晚期（1660-1725）風格，以高度密集的方式來陳列瓷器的典型設計。  \n\n這批器物的造型隨歐洲市場的喜好而改變。部分顧客偏愛描繪遠東此神秘異國的圖案，其他則推崇西式花紋，如耀眼的徽章或取自版畫的山水景與人物。透過穩固的貿易網絡，歐洲的圖案樣品傳往中國，陶匠再複製於獨特的餐具上（圖3）。此種「以訛傳訛」的溝通方式往往造成怪異的作品，如將荷蘭餐盤上的阿姆斯特丹（Amsterdam）徽章錯誤寫成「AMSTEL DAM」，或將執壺的葡萄牙印章上下倒轉繪畫（圖4）。但歐洲人也為中國帶來新科技及技術，促成藝術變革，如廣泛用於本地及外銷瓷器的粉彩（法文為famille- rose，即「粉紅家族」）。受康熙、雍正和乾隆三帝器重的耶藤會士畫家郎世寧（1688- 1766），即以向中國畫家介紹西方繪畫技巧而聞名，如用於各種媒介上的平行透視法。  \n\n中國的製瓷技術，如所有成功的發明般激發競爭。先於西洲，後在歐洲，唐代末年，中東商旅將中國瓷器帶至西亞，讓伊拉克的陶工巧妙地模仿。由於缺乏天然的高額土（一種砂酸鹽含量高，令瓷器質地堅硬的礦物），陶工遂以呈白色的化妝土（一種於以水和陶土調和而成的泥漿）來模仿素白瓷的美麗。並繪上由氧化鉛提煉而成的藍彩為裝飾（圖5）。在越南，陶工以於陳朝（1225- 1400）末年傳入的中國青花瓷為藍本，塑造出胎骨較厚重、呈淡灰白色的獨特青花瓷（圖6）。這些青花瓷出產自境內主要窯址，如鄰近河內的朱鑠（Chu Dou）和巴菜（Bát Trăng）。由於當時中國的瓷器生產因社會動盪和朝代更替而中斷，越南瓷業遂把握商機，於十五世紀時更成為了亞洲境內，包括馬來西亞、泰國、印尼及菲律賓，蓬勃的陶瓷貿易之要員。  \n\n2. 學者們如伯朗（Roxanna Brown）所指的「明代對外貿易真空期」（約1370年至1570年），是指在一三二五年至一三八零年間，瓷器質易的停滞。第二波的青花瓷短缺期，使中國陶瓷生產的市場佔有率。在一三六八年至一四二四、或一四三零年間，下跌至百分之五十。隨後在弘治一朝的義務復興前，即一四二四年。或一四三零年至一四八七年間，其佔有率更得以至百分之五。此間不同以後又再度後落，直到一五六七年，明廷撤銷了海禁。政策後，才有所回升。\n\n在中國的境境，高麗皇朝（918- 1392）統治韓國接近五個世紀，並見證受中國青瓷啟發而成的藍綠色青瓷，成為了朝鮮半島的主流陶瓷。正是韓國陶匠——一群因豐臣秀吉於一五九零年代兩次入侵朝鮮而被撾至日本的工匠，對日本瓷器生產作出重大貢獻。日本早期製作的瓷器稱為「伊萬里瓷」，得名於和田窯址附近的港口。受到韓國及中國的單色釉瓷，及中國南部窯址設計靈活的青花瓷（長於燒造配合日本茶道美學的瓷器）影響，伊萬里瓷器紋理細密、具顆粒質感，圖案率真自然，藍色色調流暢而變化豐富。後來為迎合歐洲市場的品味，伊萬里瓷器變得更色彩繽紛，并然有序，甚至一度較其競爭到手——中國瓷器更受歐洲市場歡迎。\n\n3. 荷蘭人是日本統治者禁止歐洲國家在境內進行貿易的唯一例外。故他們為有田黨的海工帶來在歐洲極受歡迎的中國青花瓷。使其能以此為製陶的參考樣本。  "

    "contents": "# Porcelain manufactories in Europe  \n\nPortuguese traders were successful in returning home with samples of kaolin, which they discovered in China to be essential in the production of porcelain wares, but Europeans remained ignorant of the techniques and processes involved in the production of porcelain until 1708, when the first European hard- paste porcelain (made from a compound of the feldspathic rock petuntse and kaolin clay fired at around  $1400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ) was made in Meissen, Germany by Johann Friedrich Böttger. With support from the porcelain- obsessed Augustus II the Strong of Saxony (who on his death in 1733 owned 35,798 pieces of porcelain; the largest collection in Europe), Böttger established a factory at Meissen, just outside Dresden, in 1710, and was soon producing large amounts of hard- paste porcelain. In the 1720s, the Meissen factory developed a new and extensive range of enamel colours, and the factory's painters excelled in fantastic depictions of life in an imagined Far East. These successes were soon followed by the founding of a second factory in Vienna by Claudius du Paquier, assisted by the former kiln master from Meissen, which began making hard- paste porcelain by about 1719. A number of other factories opened in Germany in the 1740s and '50s, often with workers from Meissen or Vienna who provided the necessary technical expertise.  \n\nThe discoveries in Meissen were followed by the establishment of major factories elsewhere in Europe. In Italy, where soft- paste porcelain (an imitation, low- fired porcelain that lacked the ingredients found in hard- paste porcelain) had been made at the Medici workshops since the late sixteenth century, Francesco Vezzi established a porcelain factory in Venice that began producing hard- paste porcelain in significant numbers in 1720. Experiments by the Marchese Carlo Ginori led to the development of a hard- paste porcelain factory in Doccia, near Florence in 1737, which produced works inspired by delicate white wares from Dehua (fig. 7). Both men were assisted by workers from the Du Paquier factory, and Doccia porcelain from the 1740s sometimes features painted decoration that reflects the influence of Du Paquier porcelain—demonstrating the atmosphere of technological and stylistic exchange that characterised the European ceramic industry of the eighteenth century.  \n\nKaolin was not discovered in France until the second half of the eighteenth century, and all French porcelain produced before 1770 was soft- rather than hard- paste. Both types were first made in factories which had previously produced the most common ceramic product of the time—faience, a type of tin- glazed earthenware—like those in Rouen and Saint- Cloud. Perhaps the most successful of these was at Sèvres in the western part of Paris, which had moved from its former premises in Vincennes in 1756. With the financial backing of King Louis XV (r. 1715–1774), the Sèvres factory soon came to dominate not only the French ceramic industry, but also the entirety of European ceramics for the second half of the eighteenth century. Innovative and experimental new forms were always in development, and the factory looked to different sources of inspiration, such as Japanese lacquer (fig. 8). By the mid- 1750s, it had overtaken the Meissen factory in terms of production and innovation. It remained at the forefront of European porcelain production for the rest of the century.  \n\nAcross the channel, English manufacturers struggled to discover the secrets of making porcelain without access to the necessary ingredients, and between the 1740s and 1760s were only able to develop formulae that created a range of supports porcelain materials for tableware. This has argued after the discovery of kaolin clay in Cornwall in 1746 by an English chemist named William Cookworthy, who soon found even better- quality clay in St Stephen's, near St Austell. After two decades of experimentation, Cookworthy patented his recipe for making porcelain and established the Plymouth China factory in 1768—the first in England to manufacture hard- paste porcelain. By the turn of the century, England had a flourishing porcelain industry, with factories in Derby, Worcester, Staffordshire, Liverpool and elsewhere. Primarily commercial ventures that operated without noble or royal financial support, they were run by entrepreneurs and artisans, and much of their output was aimed at a growing middle class.  \n\nThe European factories were so successful that eventually the demand for Chinese porcelain began to diminish, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the trade fell into serious decline. But centuries of genuine artistic exchange stimulated by the trade in porcelain had left an indelible mark on the arts of Europe. Chinese ceramics remain a potent source of design ideas for artists today, working in fields as diverse as architecture, interior design, theatre and painting.  \n\nBen Chiesa Assistant Curator, University Museum and Art Gallery, The University of Hong Kong\n\n4. Some scholars have suggested that English manufacturers may have produced hard-paste porcelain before Böttger, but his factory in Meisen was certainly the first to produce it in large quantities (Queiroz and Agathopoulos 2005).

    "contents": "# 歐洲瓷廠  \n\n雖然葡萄牙商人成功將於中國發現的製瓷關鍵材料高嶺土樣本帶回家鄉，但歐洲人對瓷器的製作技術與過程仍一無所知。直到一七零八年，約翰·弗里德里希·伯特格爾才於德國遭森工廠研製出首件歐洲硬質瓷（混合含長石質的白墩子及高嶺土，再以的鑄氏一千四百度燒製而成）。於一七一零年，伯特格爾得到薩克森連侯奧古斯特二世（瓷器狂熱愛好者，於一七二三年逝世時坐擁三萬五七千瓦大力小件瓷器，屬歐洲最大的收藏）的質助，在德勒斯登外的遜森成立工廠，並迅速投入生產大量半透明的奶白色硬質瓷。一七二零年代，遜森工廠研製出一系列新的釉彩，畫師亦擅長繪畫栩栩如生、想像中的遠東人文風景。在這項巨大的成功與前遇森工廠的畫師協助下，克勞斯·都帕契爾隨即在一七一九年於維也立成立第二間生產硬質瓷的工廠。其他普瑪會聘用具相關的專業技藝，曾在遜森或維也立工廠工作的匠人之德國瓷廠，亦於一七四零至五零年代期間相繼落成。  \n\n遜森工廠解開製瓷之誠後，歐洲各地的主要瓷器廠亦緊隨成立。在早自十六世紀末，已有麥  \n\n4. 近年有研究指出：其他英國工業家或埃弗里德·切恩豪斯·可能較怕特格爾更早研製出瓷器。但德國的遇森工廠的確是歐洲首問大量生產硬質瓷的瓷廠（Queiroz and Agathopoulos 2005）。  \n\n 地奇工作坊烧造軌質瓷（一種以低溫魏、且缺乏製成硬質瓷原材料的仿瓷器）的意大利，法蘭西斯科·韋爾於一七二零年在威尼斯建立工廠，大量生產硬質瓷。馬切斯·卡羅·基諾里的實驗使位於佛羅倫斯附近的多西亞瓷廠於一七三七年得以成立，並以生產靈感器精緻的德化白瓷之硬質瓷（圖7）。韋爾和基諾里均得到都帕契爾工廠的工人協助，故一七四零年代出產的多西亞瓷器的彩繪裝飾，偶爾折射出都帕契爾瓷器的特色——展現出十八世紀歐洲陶瓷工業之間的工藝和風格交流之氛圍。  \n\n直到十八世紀下半葉，法國才發現高嶺土，故一七七零年前燒造的法國瓷器，都是軌質瓷而非硬質瓷。燒造兩種瓷器的瓷廠，昔日都是以生產當時最普遍的彩陶——一種涂上錫釉的陶器為主，就如盧昂和聖克盧的作坊一樣。其中最成功的，可能是巴黎西部的塞爾夫工廠。該廠於一七五六年從萬塞滿的舊址搬遷至此。在法國國王路易十五（執政年份為1715年至1774年）的經濟支持下，塞爾夫工廠不但迅速獨霸法國的陶瓷工業，更主導十八世紀下半葉的歐洲陶瓷工業發展。塞爾夫工廠持續發展卻新與進行改革實驗，又追尋各種創作靈感，如日本漆器（圖8）。故此，塞爾夫工廠在一七五零年代中業，就產量與創辦層面，已取代德森工廠成為十八世紀歐洲陶瓷生產的先鋒。  \n\n由於缺乏製瓷的關鍵材料，即使彼岸的英國製造商致力研究製瓷秘方，在一七四零年代至一七六零年代間，仍只能研製出一系列不適合用作餐具的軟質瓷的配方。當一名英國化學家威廉·考克沃西於一七四六年，在康瓦爾郡發現高嶺土（他隨即於聖奧斯特蘭附近的聖司提反發現質量更好的瓷土）後，英國瓷業即發生巨變。經過二十年的製瓷配方實驗後，考克沃西申請專利並於一七六八年成立英國首間製造真正瓷器的工廠——普利茅斯瓷廠。十八世紀末、十九世紀初，英國瓷器工業發展蓬勃，工廠颯佈德比、烏斯特·史丹佛郡及利物浦等地。這些瓷廠並為得到主公質族的支持，而是由企業家及藝術家領導的商營企業，其產品亦以不斷增長的中產階級為銷售對象。  \n\n歐洲瓷廠的業務非常成功，使歐洲對中國瓷器的需求逐漸減少。十八世紀末，對華貿易更經歷嚴重衰退。但歷經數個世紀，由瓷器貿易所激發直擊的藝術交流，對歐洲藝術烙下不能磨滅的影響。中國陶瓷更成為了建築、室內設計、戲劇及繪畫等多元界別的藝術家源源不絕的靈感來源。  \n\n紀奕邦香港大學美術博物館助理館長  "

    "contents": "# Blue-and-white  \n\nPerhaps the first truly global commodity, blue- and- white porcelain reached a wider audience than any other type of Chinese ceramic. Sent to markets in Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, India, the Middle East and even Africa, it inspired potters in major ceramic centres to produce elegant ceramics of their own design; from the rich turquoise fritwares of fifteenth- century Iznik, to elaborately panelled Japanese kraak wares from seventeenth century Arita. Blue- and- white porcelain was also the first to be collected in Europe in large numbers, sparking a craze for things Chinese in the sixteenth century that would last well into the nineteenth, as new generations of artists and collectors rediscovered and renewe the art form.  \n\nThe earliest surviving Chinese blue- and- white ceramics were made in the Tang period, when kilns in northern China dominated the production of both high- fired white stonewares and porcelains. A shared creation of China and the Islamic Middle East, they were decorated with cobalt blue imported from northeast Persia or the Arabian Peninsula, using decorative techniques invented by potters in Basra, Iraq to embellish tin- glazed earthenwares. These earthenwares were themselves developed in imitation of Chinese white wares, demonstrating the remarkable hybridity of early ceramic industries in Asia.  \n\nTang blue- and- white ceramics represented a brief period of experimentation that was not repeated until the fourteenth century, when strong familial, cultural and economic ties to the Islamic world and the stabilisation of overland trade routes under the Mongol- led Yuan dynasty opened new markets and made access to imported cobalt easier. Yuan imperial patronage turned the kilns of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province into the largest porcelain production centre in China.  \n\nCombined with a cultural policy that promoted artistic exchange between different ethnic groups, this patronage created an atmosphere of experimentation that allowed new forms and styles to develop, including highly finished works intended for the court and less formal wares for the export market, transported along the silk road and from major ports like Canton and Quanzhou.\n\nThe success of Yuan blue- and- whites laid the foundations for the dominance of the export industry in the Ming and Qing dynasties, when millions of ceramics were produced in the imperial kilns and private commercial enterprises. Tailored with specific designs for certain markets, they often found their way elsewhere. The Portuguese purchased blue- and- white porcelain made for the Malay Peninsula in Malacca, and when the Dutch established a foothold in the Indonesian Archipelago in the first decades of the seventeenth century, they gained access to the important transhipment hub of Batavia (Jakarta), from which over twelve million Chinese ceramics were shipped to Holland between 1607 and 1684. Not all of these were designed with European consumers in mind and Dutch still- life oil paintings reveal that porcelains in shapes seemingly made for non- European customers were sold and used in Europe.  \n\nBlue- and- white porcelain remained the most popular export form until the end of the seventeenth century, when growing European interest in wares decorated with coats of arms encouraged the use of polychrome enamels that allowed for more detailed, accurate depictions of heraldry. The Jingdezhen kilns, still the most important in China, responded to this demand and the trade in colourful porcelain supplanted blue- and- white to become the defining aspect of Chinese export porcelain in the eighteenth century.

    "contents": "# Porcelain terminology  \n\nPorcelain terminologyThe Chinese term 'ci' (translated as porcelain in English) refers to all ceramics that are fired at high temperatures, including porcelain and stoneware. In the West, the term porcelain refers specifically to white ceramics made with a special type of clay called kaolin and fired to a temperature of about  $1300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , which results in a translucent, glassy material that makes a ringing sound when struck. Stoneware is used to refer to related ceramics that are similarly hard and dense, but which are made with grey or brown clay, may or may not be white- bodied, do not transmit light, and are fired to a slightly lower temperature of 1000 to  $1250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . Ceramics fired below this temperature range are called earthenwares. The terms 'poro- porcelain' or 'porcellaneous' are sometimes used to describe early ceramics made with some of the same ingredients and physical characteristics of porcelain."

    "contents": "# Marks  \n\nMany different marks can be found on Chinese porcelain. The most prevalent in this catalogue are imperial marks that occur on pieces for the court and related institutions from the Ming dynasty onward. They usually consist of six characters (sometimes four) in two rows that are read from right to left and from top to bottom, or in seal script within a square. The first two characters indicate the dynasty (for instance Da Ming, 'the great Ming dynasty'). The next two give the reign name (nian hao) of the ruling emperor, for instance Jiajing, or Wanli. The last two characters mean 'made during the period of' (nian zhi). This tradition was continued during the Qing dynasty. Imperial Ming and Qing marks also occur on non- imperial wares and even on export porcelain.  \n\nOther character marks and seal marks may have many different meanings: a wish for good luck, a date, a quality comparison, an owner or factory, or an indication for use in a specific setting.  \n\nIndividual potter's marks are rare on Jingdezhen porcelain, but they occur much more frequently on porcelain from Dehua. Marks are usually found on the bottom of a piece, sometimes on the edge or shoulder, or in the centre."
