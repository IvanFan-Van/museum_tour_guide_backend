# Pair of wine cups  

Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), Jiajing period, 1522- 1566 Porcelain with underglaze blue, height  $10.5\mathrm{cm}$  HKU.C.1957.0196  

With large flaring mouths, vessels of this shape resemble inverted bells and are commonly referred to as 'chime- type cups'. Popular throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties, this pair was made during the reign of the Jiajing emperor. In keeping with the emperor's interest in auspicious symbolism, the three goats and suns surrounded by prunus, pine and bamboo trees are another example of the use of homophones in the Chinese language to create visual puns. The goats and suns (both pronounced yang) form a rebus that refers to a passage from the I Ching ("The Book of Changes"): "the first month of the year is the Trigram of Tai, after which three suns rise". The passage denotes the passing of seasons as winter (associated with the cosmic force of yin) ends and spring (associated with yang) arrives, and carries an auspicious message of renewal.
