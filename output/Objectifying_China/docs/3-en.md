# Plate  

Delfit, the Netherlands, ca. 1710 Tin- glazed earthenware, diameter 35.7 cm Asian Civilisations Museum, 2007- 55840 Gift of Mr and Mrs Toshio Egawa  

This Dutch plate is entirely of European origin but decorated in a predominantly Chinese style. The overall decoration imitates Chinese familia verte porcelain, with stylised scroll and flower motifs mostly in green. The floral and scroll borders are arranged in a manner that seems inspired by kraak porcelain. The central figure is of European invention and represents a personification of abundance holding a richly filled cornucopia.  

Delfit potters excelled at painting Western ceramic forms with Asian motifs. These luxury goods were produced in increasing numbers and competed with imported Chinese porcelains. Delfitware inspired by Chinese originals persisted from about 1630 to the mid- eighteenth century, and since about 1640, Delfit potters began using personal monograms and distinctive factory marks as trademarks to distinguish their work, like a blue K' with a dot on the underside of this plate.  

Large flat plates like this one are also called 'chargers'. They were often used as decorative accessories in well- appointed interiors. The lack of wear on this example suggests that it served an ornamental function. It may have been placed on top of a buffet or cabinet, by itself or with additional pieces of European and Asian ceramics, or brass, pewter or silver vessels.
