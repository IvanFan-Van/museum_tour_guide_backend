# Bottle (yuhuchun)  

China (Yuan dynasty), 14th century Porcelain with underglaze blue, height  $25.5\mathrm{cm}$  HKU.C.1978.0632  

Bottles of this shape take their name from Song dynasty literary references to decanters for rice wine (yuhuchun), although they may also have been used as water containers. Highly prized by the upper echelons of Chinese society, they were popular exports to Southeast Asia, Korea, Japan, India and the Middle East, and have been recovered from excavations as far afield as Kenya. They were made in a variety of forms to suit different tastes: from monochrome, blue- and- white and overglaze painted examples, to elaborately gilded works on precious silver.  

The earliest surviving porcelain yuhuchun are monochrome wares that date the Song dynasty. These porcelain wares were to have been particularly well received in Japan, where they were favoured by tea masters. They were also among the first Chinese porcelains to arrive in the West in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, presented as rare gifts to the ruling houses of Europe via intermediaries in the Middle East. Yuhuchun decorated with cobalt blue were not produced until the Yuan dynasty, when the reopening of overland trade routes between China and Central Asia allowed Chinese potters to import high- quality cobalt more easily.  

Made on a larger scale than earlier examples, blue- and- white yuhuchun were sometimes made in faceted shapes, reflecting different approaches in the Yuan dynasty to the properties of clay as an expressive medium. While Song yuhuchun were mostly thrown on the potter's wheel and allowed to grow naturally into shapes with minimal guidance from the potter's hands, Yuan examples make greater use of the plastic quality of the clay in modelling and moulding. They were often decorated with imagery inspired by designs found on objects from the Islamic world, such as the patterns resembling Islamic calligraphy on this bottle.

7. A yuhuchun named the Fonthill Vase for its previous owner William Beckford of Fonthill Abbey (who acquired it on one of his trips to Paris in 1793, 1803 or 1814) is one of the earliest recorded Chinese porcelain vessels to have been exported to the office of the National Library of Great value, it was once mounted as a ewer in silver-gilt for Ladisdas the Great of Hungary (r. 1342-1382), who gave it to Charles III of Durazzo in 1381 on his ascent to the throne of Naples, and is depicted as such in a watercolour drawing by the French antiquarian Roger de Gaignières, ca. 1713, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris. The vase itself has been in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin since the 1860s.
