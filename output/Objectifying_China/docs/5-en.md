Worcester, England, 1770s Soft- paste porcelain, diameter 22.2 cm Asian Civilisations Museum, 2007- 55811 Gift of Mr and Mrs Toshio Egawa  

This pattern with a phoenix and a qilin, surrounded by krauk- style panels of flora and fauna, is based on an early eighteenth- century Chinese design, though the creature takes on an even more fantastical appearance in the hands of the Worcester enamellers. The Chinese famille vete originals from the Kangzi reign feature brighter colours.  

This design first appeared on Worcester porcelain around 1770, and was only used to decorate dessert services. The design is called the Bishop Summer pattern, possibly after one of two bishops named Sumner in the later eighteenth and nineteenth century, who may have owned a Worcester service with this pattern.  

The Worcester porcelain factory distinguished itself from other manufactories in England through the use of large proportions of soaprock in its ceramics, which made them tougher than most other types of English porcelain and better able to withstand sudden changes in temperature.
