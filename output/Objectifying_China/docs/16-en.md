# Qingbai and celadon  

Centuries before the flowering of blue- and- white wares in the fourteenth century, large kiln sites in northern and southern China were producing glazed porcelain and stoneware in various shades of blue, green and white, which were adorned with elegant incised decoration. Some of the most famous of these include qinghai (green- white), a translucent porcelain with a bluish- green glaze produced at kiln complexes in Jingdezhen and Jizhou, and celadon, a type of porcelain or stoneware with an olive- green glaze that takes its name from a character with a distinctive outfit in L'Astré, a seventeenth- century French comedy. Similar in colour to valuable jade, these ceramics were among the most highly regarded in China—particularly celadon from the Longquan kilns in Lishui, Zhejiang province, which supplied the Southern Song court after the collapse of the northern dynasty in 1127. Today, some scholars prefer the term 'greenware' for these ceramics to avoid using arbitrary Western nomenclature.  

Chinese qinghai and celadon wares were also exported to East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Islamic world—where the latter was thought to break or change colour if touched by poison. They were most eagerly collected in regions situated firmly within China's sphere of cultural and political influence, such as Japan. Song dynasty celadon shipped from Ningbo in Zhejiang province to Japan. During the Kamakura period (1185- 1333), celadon became the favoured form of utensils and interior decoration for the Japanese too. Furthermore, and former part of a fashion for karamono (Chinese things), attested to by the thousands of shards recovered from historic sites and many intact examples preserved in major Japanese temples.  

In Korea, refined Chinese celadon pieces brought to the imperial court by official embassies in the Goryeo period (918- 1392) were seen as the pinnacle of ceramic artistry. Local potters were soon making their own versions, combining stylistic elements drawn directly from Chinese wares as well as new designs articulated for Korean consumers. And in Mainland Southeast Asia, green- glazed ceramics reminiscent of celadon were among the first stonewares to be produced, 

using kiln technologies from China that allowed ceramics to be fired at much higher temperatures. They were made at a number of sites in Vietnam along the Red River Delta during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and most famously at Sawankhalok in the fifteenth century, when they formed one of the early Thai kingdom's most important export commodities.  

Celadon was never sent to Europe in significant numbers, nor were they ever made with Western consumers in mind. The rare examples that did arrive were diplomatic gifts from rulers in the Islamic world, which were sometimes given elaborate mottleshack items. Only three surviving Chinese rattunin pieces can be documented as reaching Europe before 1500: the Fonthill Vase (now in Dublin), which is qingba; a Longquan celadon dish presented to Lorenzo de' Medici by the Mamukh Sultan of Egypt in 1487; and the 'Katzenelnbogen bowl', bought by an aristocratic German pilgrim in the Holy Land in 1433- 1434, who on his return had it given a cover and mount in gilded silver.  

This absence was most likely the result of changing fashions in Asia. By the time Europe began direct trade with China in the sixteenth century, celadon wares had largely been supplanted in the domestic market by blue- and- white porcelain. Established kilns that had focused on celadon before the fourteenth century turned their attention to the production of blue- and- white wares—although some—such as the kilns in Longquan, Cizhou and Jizhou—continued to produce celadon and other monochromatic ceramics in smaller quantities, and Song examples remained popular among collectors in later periods.  

15. Qinghai is also referred to as yingqing (shadow green), although this name appears only to date from the eighteenth century. Other theories for the origin of celadon suggest that the name is a corruption of 'Saladin', the Ayyubid Sultan, who in 1171 sent forty pieces of the ceramic to the Sultan of Syria, or that it derives from the Sanskrit words sila and dhara, which mean 'green' and 'stone'.
