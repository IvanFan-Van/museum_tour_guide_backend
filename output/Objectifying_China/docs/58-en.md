Meissen, Germany. ca. 1735Hard- paste porcelain, diameter 7.1 cm (tea bowl), 12 cm (saucer)Asian Civilisations Museum, 2007- 55790, 2007- 55789Gift of Mr and Mrs Toshio Egawa  

Made in Meissen, the centre of porcelain production near Dresden, this tea bowl and saucer demonstrates the popularity of Dehua porcelain in Europe during the first half of the eighteenth century. Like Chinese porcelain, Meissen ware is a hard- paste porcelain, which more closely duplicates the glassy surface of blanc de Chine than earlier European soft- paste porcelain.  

The moulded prunus branches on the tea bowl were a popular Dehua motif widely emulated on Western porcelain. Motifs were sometimes altered as they were taken up in the West; the vegetation on the saucer more closely resembles grape vines.
