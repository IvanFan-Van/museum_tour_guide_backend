# Pair of ko-akae plates  

China (Ming dynasty), Tianqi period, 1621- 1627 Porcelain with overglaze enamels, width 18.5 cm HKU.C.1978.0627  

Painted in a wuxai palette of red, green, brown and yellow overglaze enamels the scenes on these plates show a Buddhist monk seated on the ground surrounded by tea utensils. The figure may be Kanaka Bharadvaja, iuohan (perfected being, rakan in Japanese), who in Buddhist art is commonly depicted with a book and a fly whisk. Called ko- akae (old red wares) in Japan, they are the colourful equivalents of ko- sometsuke dishes made in China in the seventeenth century for use in meals accompanying the Japanese tea ceremony.  

The plates feature characteristic surface flaws that tea practitioners found appealing, such as glaze bubbles and worn edges. But the protective brown enamel on the rims and greater regularity and delicacy of shape when compared to many ko- sometsuke speak to the complex aesthetic of the tea ceremony—which was defined as much by individual practitioners as the sensibility of austerity, spontaneity and apparent artlessness promoted by influential masters like Saoung Rikyū (1522- 1591). Though marked on the back with the marks of the Daoguang emperor, such wares were produced during a relatively brief period between the reigns of the Tianqi and Kangxi emperor. These reign marks were probably added later to increase the prestige of the objects or as a mark of respect.  

Other names for ko- akae include Tenkei akae, based on their prolific production during the reign of the Tianqi emperor (called Tenkei in Japanese), and Nankou akae, due to the Japanese belief that they were decorated in Nanjing. They were rarely exported to Europe, where more highly finished and thinly bodied polychrome ceramics were preferred.
