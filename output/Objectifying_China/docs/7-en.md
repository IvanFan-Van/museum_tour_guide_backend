# Milk jug

Chinese figures frequently appear on porcelain made in English factories in the 1700s. Some wares are close copies of Chinese originals, and may have been produced to replace broken or missing pieces in valuable sets imported from China. Other objects feature freely adapted patterns, such as the figures on the sparrow- beak milk jug from a coffee service. Boys with a lady holding a fan are painted on both objects. The simple figures are rendered almost as caricature, with facial features and hair delineated with just a few brushstrokes. This manner of drawing is characteristic of the enamelled wares produced by John Pennington at the Copperas Hill works, an important porcelain factory in Liverpool.
