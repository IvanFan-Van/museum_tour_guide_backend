Once one of the largest manufacturing centres of celadon in China, by the time of the Qing dynasty the Longquan kilns had declined significantly. Of the more than three hundred individual kilns operating in Longquan during the Song and Yuan dynasties, fewer than a third remained active in the seventeenth century, though they continued to produce works of occasional brilliance. Primarily intended for antiquarian collectors or commissioned by the imperial court, this later type of celadon evoked the taste and styles of earlier periods. But a revival of interest during the reigns of the Kangxi and Yongzheng emperors led to the development of several new techniques and forms, such as the delicate, almost watery, tone of celadon on this vaseâ€”a Kangxi innovation that was produced by increasing the amount of iron typically found in celag dynasty Longquan celadon glazes.
