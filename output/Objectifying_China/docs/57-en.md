Figural pairDehua, China (Qing dynasty), 18th centuryPorcelain with ivory glaze and enamel, height 11 cmAsian Civilisations Museum, 2010- 00362This figural group shows a lady in layered robes with her right arm raised, seemingly in protestation, with a male figure encircling her in his arms. Traces of gold pointed enamel (applied after the pottery had been both glazed and fired) reveal how red and black were used to embellish the lips, robes, hair and shoes of the figures. This was probably the work of a European enameller attempting to mimic the vivid colours of polychrome porcelains, which were increasingly popular in Europe in the eighteenth century. Figures such as this constituted an important part of the output at the Dehua kilns, and many made for export were based on scenes inspired by popular Dutch genre paintings.
