# Pair of plates  

England, mid- 18th century  Tin- glazed earthenware, diameter 21.6 cm (below), 29.8 cm (right)  Asian Civilisations Museum, 2007- 55836, 2007- 55853  Gift of Mr and Mrs Toshio Egawa  

Tin- glazed earthenware produced in England was also known as deflware, because the decoration was painted in the style of ceramics from Delft. The scenes on both plates are free interpretations rather than slavish copies of actual Chinese designs. The decorators have attempted to create figures that look Chinese by depicting them with Chinese- style robes and setting them in landscapes derived from Chinese porcelain. The pagoda and the Asian- style parasol were also meant to evoke the East.
