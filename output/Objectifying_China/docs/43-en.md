# Plate  

Delfit, the Netherlands, ca. 1670s Tin- glazed earthenware, diameter 22.6 cm Asian Civilisations Museum, 2007- 55819 Gift of Mr and Mrs Toshio Egawa  

The worn edges along the rim of this plate reveal its earthenware body, demonstrating that Delfit ceramics were only able to mimic Chinese porcelain on the outer surface and could not recreate the translucency and hardness of true porcelain. The reddish- brown earthenware was glazed with tin oxide, which resulted in a white outer layer after firing. Delfit designers were better able to match the appearance of Chinese export ceramics in their surface decoration. They boast a wide variety of designs including floral motifs, animals, landscapes, family crests and religious subjects. This plate is decorated with a stag amidst flowering plants, a well- known design on seventeenth century master water
