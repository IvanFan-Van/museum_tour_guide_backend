# Incense burner  

Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), 16th or 17th century Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter 17.3 cm HKUC.1954.0122  

This blue- and- white incense burner is modelled after monochrome porcelain examples from the Song and Yuan dynasties. It is decorated with a scene in cobalt blue underglaze depicting a man with a shaved pate standing among pavilions and banana plant leaves. Wearing a water- proof cape, he may be a hunter or outdoorsman. The absence of reign marks and the lively, imprecise painting style are typical of non- imperial blue- and- white porcelain made in private kilns during the so- called 'transitional period' between the collapse of the Ming dynasty and the stabilisation of Qing rule.  

Its roughly potted body is covered in small flaws in the form of glaze blubber mistakes, fries and grit on the surface, the roughness of pores during the field of the bond properly with the clay. Porcelains like this were particularly popular in Japan, where their imperfections were appreciated by practitioners of the tea ceremony, which celebrated an aesthetic of austerity, spontaneity and apparent artlessness known as wahi. By the early seventeenth- century substantial quantities of Chinese ceramics made with obvious surface flaws (described positively as mushikai, worm- eaten in Japanese) began to be made specifically for this market. These wares, termed ko- sometsuk (old blue- and- white) by nineteenth- century Japanese connoisseurs, were produced in forms that included tea bowls, tea pots, water containers, vases, food trays and incense burners.  

Though ko- sometsuk do not appear to have been exported to the West (none have been recovered from the remains of seventeenth- century vessels carrying goods to Europe), they had a profound impact on the form and styles of late Japanese ceramics made in Arita. Arita wares competed with Chinese kilns in the seventeenth century for a share of the European market and inspired the development of innovative decorative designs that combined both Japanese and Chinese designs at various European ceramic factories, such as Worcester and Derby.
