# Jar (quan)  

China (Ming dynasty), Jiajing period, 1545, or 19th century Porcelain with underglaze blue,  $31\times 30$  cm HKU.C.1992.0967  

Large jars of this shape, called quan, were used for the storage of wine. Oversized examples with extremely fine painting also had an additional ornamental function, and were occasionally used to decorate imperial palaces, grounds. They were popular export items to the Middle East and Southeast Asia in the fourteenth century, with comparable jars preserved in the Arabic Shrine, Iran, and Wat Mahathat, a temple in Lamphun, Thailand.  

An inscription at the centre locates the production of this jar to Jingdezhen in the 24th year of the reign of the Jiajing emperor (1545)—although similar jars were imitated well into the nineteenth century. Blue- and- white guan jars evolved significantly over the course of the Yuan and Ming dynasties. The neck of this guan is significantly wider than most fourteenth- century examples, which also had lower shoulders, sometimes with small handles attached. The banded floral decoration is typical of the mid- Ming period, although vessels painted with peacocks—a symbol of beauty, power and the Ming court—are more unusual.
