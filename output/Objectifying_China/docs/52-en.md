# Pair of ogee-form bowls  

Jingdezhen, China (Qing dynasty), Qianlong period, 1736- 1795 Porcelain with underglaze blue and brown glaze, height 8.2 cm HKUC.1964.0291  

The brown glazes used on Batavian wares were produced in a variety of shades, including a light brown referred to as cafe au lait (coffee with milk in French). This colour was achieved in much the same way as the deep- brown glaze used on the previous bowl, but with a lesser amount of iron- oxide added during the firing process. Caf√© au lait porcelain was commonly over- decorate with coloured enamels on arrival in Europe. In Germany, wheel- engraving, in which craftsmen removed sections of the glaze to expose the white porcelain beneath in controlled patterns, was another technique used to enliven these objects.
