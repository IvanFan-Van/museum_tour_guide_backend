Made for Christians in Asia and the West, this Virgin and Child sculpture was inspired by figures of Guanyin. When depicted with a child, Guanyin was known as the 'bringer of sons', so it was natural for potters in Dehua to adapt their models for the Christian market. The figures can be clearly identified based on the curly hair of the child, the non- Chinese headdress of the woman and the orb with a cross in the hands of the infantâ€”the globus cruciger (cross bearing orb' in Latin) of Christian iconography.  

Thirty- nine porcelain figures called Sancta Marias (blessed Marys'), probably Virgin and Child figures such as this, are recorded in the sale list for the carvings of the Nassau (along with 170 related women with children figures), an English ship which returned from Xiamen in 1699. Demonstrating their appeal among the noble houses of Europe, dated inventories show that figures of a woman and child, probably representing Guanyin, were also in the Dresden woman collection of Augustus II the Strong, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony (1670- 1733), as well as in the smaller collection of William and King of the of England (r. 1689- 1702) and Queen Mary II (r. 1689- 1694) at Kensington House, London.
