# Kraak-style plate  

Delft, the Netherlands, ca. 1670s Tin- glazed earthenware, diameter 32.9 cm Asian Civilisations Museum, 2007- 55844 Gift of Mr and Mrs Toshio Egawa  

This plate was made in the major Dutch porcelain production centre of Delft. It combines the panelled borders of kraak porcelain with loosely painted motifs in the transitional style. The border is divided into segments of floral decoration alternating with robed figures seated in rocky landscapes. They surround a central image of two figures in a garden filled with rockwork, foliage and cloud scrolls. Based on Chinese prototypes, the Dutch painter has simplified the design so much that the figures appear almost cartoon- like.  

Although Europeans failed to produce hard- paste porcelain until the eighteenth century, there were numerous attempts to make earthenware imitations from an early stage. The practice of coating buff- coloured pottery with clear lead glaze mixed with tin oxide to create a white surface was most likely introduced to Europe from the Islamic world via Moorish Spain. It was practiced at numerous centres, where it came to be known by different namesâ€”Delft in Holland, delftware in England, faience in France, and Germany and maolicia in Italy. Dutch examples painted with decoration imitating blue- and- white Chinese porcelains were first produced in Haarlem in North Holland, where potters from Flanders settled after the fall of Antwerp in 1585.
