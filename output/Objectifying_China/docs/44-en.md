# Plate with a coat of arms  

Genoa, Italy, ca. 1710s Tin- glazed earthenware, diameter 25.6 cm Asian Civilisations Museum, 2007- 55829 Gift of Mr and Mrs Toshio Egawa  

The deer, birds and foliage on this maiolica plate are painted in a spontaneous style reminiscent of knak ware, tempered slightly by the formal arrangement of motifs. The design in each quarter of the outer band is repeated and separated by floral bouquets, except for an area that was intentionally left blank so that it could be personalised to suit individual buyers. That space was painted with a coat of arms in red, orange and green enamelsâ€”probably the arms of a member of the Knights of Malta. The design sought for personalised details like this were specially commissioned drawings incorporating the arms and insignia of the client.  

The quest to duplicate Chinese porcelain was an obsession shared by many connoisseurs and entrepreneurs in Europe. Early successes in Florence commissioned by Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici (r. 1574- 1587) led to the production of a type of soft- paste porcelain made from white clay and ground glass around 1575. Italian potters also attempted to imitate Chinese porcelain by applying painted decoration to traditional low- fired earthenwares with a white tin glaze called maiolica. Italian maiolica production flourished from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries and laid the foundations for other tin- glazed pottery traditions in Europe.
