# Plate  

Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), Zhengde period, 1506- 1521 Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter  $25.6 \mathrm{cm}$  HKUC.1957.0194  

The distinctive floral spray and pomegranate designs on this plate were probably developed during the Xuande period. Later revived with small refinements during the reigns of successive emperors, they were also occasionally imitated on blue- and- white wares from the Qing dynasty. The branches holding pomegranates have ragged ends, following an artistic convention intended to suggest that they were broken off from a tree. Highly prized by members of the court, similar plates were sometimes sent abroad as diplomatic gifts. Comparable examples are illustrated in the gwann tu (pictures of ancient playthings') handscroll of the British Museum, an alternate version of the handscroll from the Victoria and Albert Museum depicting the previous unikard.
