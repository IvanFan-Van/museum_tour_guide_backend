# Pair of mounted jars  

Jingdezhen, China, Qianlong period, 1736- 1795; mounts added in France, 18th or 19th century Porcelain with gilt- bronze mounts,  $45 \times 28 \mathrm{cm}$  Asian Civilisations Museum, 2014- 00709  

This pair of jars combines some of the best features of the decorative arts of eighteenth- century China and Europe. The powder blue porcelain vessels have an elegant, undulating profile. The elaborate gilded bronze mounts, which show dragons, were finely sculpted, cast and gilded in France, likely during the reign of Louis XV (1710- 1774). Imported wares were often mounted with extravagant gilt- bronze settings, which adopted the stylistic vocabulary and fantastic forms of French rococo, while also making unfamiliar Chinese forms more useable in European interiors. Merchants called marchands- merciers, who specialised in marketing luxury objects, facilitated the addition of such mountings for the exchange of foreign objects and the creation of new forms of decorativeators.  

This pair of vessels demonstrates the high regard for fine Chinese porcelain in the European courts. In France, the earliest recorded Chinese (blue and white) ceramic object reached the court of Henry II (1519- 1539) via Constantinople, a gift from Suleiman the Magnificent (1494- 1566). Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Further gifts presented by the Siamese ambassador Phra Narai (1633- 1688) to Louis XIV (1638- 1715) in 1686, and objects imported by the French East India Company (since 1664) helped spread a fashion for such exotica. The intense blue of these Chinese jars may well have been an inspiration for the Sevres blue for which the French royal manufactory became so famous later in the eighteenth century.
