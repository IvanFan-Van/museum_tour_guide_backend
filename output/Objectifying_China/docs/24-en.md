# Bowl with cranes and clouds  

Korea (Goryeo dynasty), 918â€“1392Porcelain with celadon glaze, height 6.1 cmHKU.C.1964.0266  

Decorated with scrolling floral patterns and flying cranes among clouds, this bowl is an example of a type of celadon with inlaid designs called sanggam chengja. Unique to Korea, this technique involves etching the desired motifs onto a dry clay body and filling in the carved space with a black or white slip. In the mid- twelfth century, possibly inspired by contemporary metalworking and lacquer techniques.  

Much of the symbolism used in Korean art was adapted from the Chinese decorative repertoire as a result of the close cultural ties between the two countries. Many designs used on celadon wares and other decorative objects are associated with Buddhism, Daoism or Confucianism, which at various times were supported by the ruling class and came to permeate social and religious life. The cranes on this bowl would have carried similar associations with cranes in China, which symbolise longevity. The swirling cloud patterns in the background were a common decorative backdrop used to supplement central motifs and are almost identical to patterns found on Goryeo embroidery.
