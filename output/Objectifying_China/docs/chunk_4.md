# Note to the reader  

Objects illustrated in this volume are from the collection of the University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) unless otherwise noted. Dimensions exclude mounting; height precedes width precedes depth.  

Chinese names are given in the traditional order, surnames first, with the exception of scholars who have adopted the Western order of surname last. Chinese transliterations for personal names, places and titles of works follow the Pinyin system of romanisation, except for words adopted into English and commonly used place names such as Macau (Pinyin: Aomen). Foreign terms are italicised unless commonly used in English.
