# Plate in fencai enamels  

Jingdezhen, China (Oisei dynasty), Xianfeng period, 1851- 1861 porcelain with overglaze enamels,  $17 \times 2.8 \mathrm{cm}$  HKUC.1981.0856  

The design on this irregularly- shaped plate shows a landscape with two scholars enjoying nature and playing go. A young man, probably an attendant, crosses a bridge with picnic supplies. The plum trees and chrysanthemum blossoms in the foreground are painted in soft pink- reds that are a hallmark of the famille rose palette, called fencai (powdered colours) in Chinese.  

Marked with the reign marks of the Xianfeng emperor, the plate represents a rare example of porcelain produced during a period of intense political chaos. Xianfeng's reign saw rebels from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom seize much of southern China in the 1850s, including Jingdezhen, which they burned to the ground in 1853. The kilns were not rebuilt until the rebels were defeated in 1864, by which time China was suffering increasing encroachment by European powers.
