# Foliate bowl with scrolling florals  

China (Southern Song dynasty), 1127- 1279 Porcelain with white- green glaze, diameter 22 cm HKU.C.1989.0958  

Qinghai wares were first produced in the early Northern Song dynasty at kilns in Jingdezhen, which at the time were successfully manufacturing celadon wares for the local market. Their icy blue- green tinge was produced by applying a glaze with small amounts of iron to a fine porcelain stone and kaolin clay body, which was fired in an oxygen- deprived atmosphere. The colour of their glazes ranged from a very thin and pale white to a pale blue- green that is often associated with celadon. A related form of qinghai with iron oxide seemingly randomly spotted and splashed over vessels was one of the earliest experiments in underglaze decoration. The scrolling floral patterns on these bowls were common decorative forms used on contemporary chinesis and sherifes of the Song dynasty.  

Qinghai wares were produced in a variety of forms for the domestic market, including utilitarian bowls, dishes and teapots for daily use and more elaborate figures and jars for burial. Though not generally made for the imperial court, they were appreciated by Song connoisseurs, such as the ceramic historian Jiang Qi who likened qinghai to jade in his Tao ji (Records on Ceramics), written between 1214- 1234. Valuable export items, their popularity with various trading communities in Java is mentioned in Zhao Rugua (1170- 1231) Zhufanzhi (A Description of Barbarian Nations, Records of Foreign People), a thirteenth- century document which describes foreign customs and commodities traded in South East Asia and the Indian Ocean during the Song dynasty.
