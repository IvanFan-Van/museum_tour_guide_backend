# Tea bowl  

China, probably decorated in the Netherlands, 18th century Porcelain, diameter 7.5 cm Asian Civilisations Museum, 2007- 55816 Gift of Mr and Mrs Toshio Egawa  

This porcelain tea bowl was exported from China without decoration. The river scenes and flowers were added in Europe, probably by enamellers in the Netherlands, a practice which started there and in Germany in the eighteenth century. The painting of designs onto porcelain blanks was undertaken to enhance the appeal or to disguise imperfections of the plain wares, much like on eighteenth- century porcelain from Dehua. The exterior is decorated with four cartouches. Two contain freely painted flowers, while the other two frame river scenes.
