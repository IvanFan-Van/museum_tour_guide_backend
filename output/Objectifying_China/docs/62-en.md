# Enamelled porcelain  

The decoration of ceramics with colourful patterns in China started with sancai or 'three- colour' wares from the Tang period. During the late Ming and Qing dynasties, when the trade in porcelain between China and the West reached new heights, porcelains decorated in red, green and yellow with outlines of blackish cobalt or underglaze blue called wucai (five- colour) became the most widely produced polychrome wares. Depending on the prominence of certain colours, they came to be known in Europe by names such as famille verte ('green family') and famille rose ('rose family'), after terms used by the French Jesuit and ceramic collector Albert Jacquemart in 1873.  

Colours were added to porcelain by applying enamels (powdered glass mixed with pigments) to unglazed clay that had been through one firing or to glazed ceramics, sometimes with underglaze decoration in blue applied beforehand. The enamels were then fused to the surface through a second firing at a relatively low temperature of about  $900^{\circ}C$ . Major advancements in the production of polychrome porcelain were achieved in the early eighteenth century, driven by the support of the Kangxi emperor—a patron of the arts who encouraged experimentation at the imperial kilns in Jingdezhen—and by the arrival of European Jesuits at court, who brought with them knowledge of Western chemistry. These innovations included the use of a greater percentage of kaolin in the firing process, the noble uses of chalting in new colour kilns rich and white, and changes to the composition and firing of glazes that led to the invention of complex hues like 'peachbloom' and 'oxblood red'.  

Enamelled porcelain proved hugely successful in Europe, and large amounts were purchased by the Dutch and British East India companies in the seventeenth century. This trade was briefly interrupted when the Qing dynasty cut off porcelain exports from 1644 to 1684, at which point traders turned to the Arita kilns in Japan. The brightly coloured objects they purchased from there were popular enough that Chinese makers were forced to imitate Japanese styles when Chinese exports resumed. European manufactories later produced their own synthesised versions, incorporating stylistic features found on export ceramics from both countries. Facing strong competition from China and Japan, they developed a wide range of goods aimed at different classes, from fine ornamental pieces for the fashion- conscious, to simply decorated items for daily use.  

Enamelled porcelain tended to be more expensive than blue- and- white porcelain, which could be produced in a single firing, and also tended to be more expensive. It was seen as particularly suitable for special commissions with personalised decoration, such as coats of arms, and could replicate designs better than blue- and- white porcelain. It was an interest in these ceramic很少 porcelain such as ones such as the demand for enamelled porcelains in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  

Many different types of enamelled porcelain were also produced for export to parts of Asia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where colourful and boldly patterned ceramics like Zhangzhou ware had been traded since the late Ming dynasty. Some were decorated with unique palettes and motifs not found on ceramics for other markets, such as the vividly contrasting colours and Hindu- Buddhist iconography of 'Bencharong' (derived from the Sanskrit word for 'five- colour') for the Siamese court, or the auspicious symbolism and bright pinks, greens and yellows of 'nyonya ware' made for Peranakan Chinese communities in the Straits Settlements.
