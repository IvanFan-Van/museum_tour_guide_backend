# Flower-shaped bowl  

China (Qing dynasty), Qianlong period, 1776 Porcelain with underglaze blue, 5.5 x 27 cm HKU.C.1991.0939  

Delicately decorated with a landscape scene showing willows, blossoming peonies and pavilions, the most striking feature of this chrysanthemum- shaped bowl is the epitaph incised in black ink on the exterior. Alongside a reign mark attributing its production to the forty- first year of the Qianlong emperor's reign, a carved inscription on the foot identifies its subject as cong wayi Raren—the wife of an imperial official. The rest of the text provides her name, Zou, and nickname (Jügw, 'lady of chrysanthemum') from which the dish presumably takes its shape. This is followed by a detailed account of her family background. Raren was the title granted for the mothers and wives of imperial officials of the seventh rank and higher during the Ming and Qing dynasties.  

Traditional epitaphs were often carved on stones or ceramics. They describe the experiences, merits and accomplishments of the deceased and were marked reserved for imperial officials and their family members. The eulogy on this bowl associates Zou with many of the feminine virtues in dynastic China, such as the Confucian triad of obedience as a daughter, wife and mother. Both 'willow' and 'stay' are pronounced liu in Chinese, and the presence of the willow at the centre of the bowl was likely an expression of yearning for Zou from her family.
