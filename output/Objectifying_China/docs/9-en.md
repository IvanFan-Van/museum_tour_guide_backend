# Brush pot  

China (Qing dynasty), Kangxi period, 1662- 1722 Porcelain with powder blue glaze and gilding, height 15 cm HKUC.1953.0050  

This brush pot is decorated with an image and inscription in gold on powder blue glaze. The text displays the poem A Visit to the Red Cliffs at Night by the Ming dynasty official Luo Hongxian, (1504- 1564). A cartographer and scholar Luo's interest in topography and the Chinese landscape is well expressed in his poem, which was written in response to the Ode to the Red Cliffs by the Northern Song scholar Su Shi (1037- 1101). Luo wrote that he visited the Red Cliffs five hundred years after Su Shi, and that the scenery was as beautiful as it was in the past. He described his attempts to retrace Su Shi's footsteps, and the sight of fishermen who came to sell fish in a silent landscape with lonely cranes flying above a river. Painted scenes accompany the poem, showing the cranes and cranes in a clear.  

Powder blue porcelains with gilded decoration were exported to Europe, but the inscriptions, shape and painted scenes on this brush pot suggest that it was made for a Chinese audienceâ€”one interested in and familiar with the scholastic named and the literati community they represented.
