# Covered sugar bowl  

England, ca. 1780 Earthenware (pearware), 9.9 x 11.7 cm Asian Civilisations Museum, 2007- 55778 Gift of Mr and Mrs Toshio Egawa  

Fascinated by the landscapes they saw in Chinese paintings and ceramics, customers in the West wanted European porcelain decorated with similar designs. But few of the craftsmen who decorated these objects had ever been to China, and their imaginations resulted in landscapes, people and animals that audiences in China would have barely recognised, such as the pagodas and trees depicted with hatched and cross- hatched lines on this bowl. Combining Asian motifs with Western embellishments, the twisted handles with moulding leaf appliques were inspired by contemporary rococo designs on ceramics and metalwares. The bowl is made of leaf fabric, a greyish earthenware with a blue- golden background, and a gold- colored finish on the sides of the bowl.
