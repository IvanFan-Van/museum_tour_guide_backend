# Rouleau vase  

China (Qing dynasty), Kangxi period, 1662- 1722 Porcelain with powder blue glaze and gilding, height 44 cm HKUC.1953.0012  

Like the brush pot, this vase is inscribed with an essay accompanied by a landscape showing a fisherman and a farmer outside the walls of a pavilion. The finely executed golden characters copy the famous preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng (Tengwang Ge Xu) by the Tang dynasty scholar Wang Bo (690- 67). An important example of Tang literature, the text was written as Wang Bo's travel to see his father in Jianzhi County (in present- day northern Vietnam), when he encountered a grand banquet on route. During the banquet he completed his text, in which he lamented his inability to benefit from his talent. He later drowned—at age 26—in the South China Sea before reaching his father.
