Sawankhalok, Thailand, 15th or 16th century Stoneware with celadon glaze, diameter  $28.6cm$  Asian Civilisations Museum, 1998- 00966  

The Thai kingdom of Sukhothai, founded in the early thirteenth century, was one of the most important ceramic production centres in Southeast Asia. There were two main centres of production: one in the capital, Sukhothai, and a larger complex in Sawankhalok (also called Si Satchanalai) to the north. The earliest celadons from these sites were probably made around 1400, with many examples recovered from the Nanyang and Longquan wrecks, which sunk in the South China Sea around 1380 and 1400 respectively.  

These wares appear to have been influenced by green- glazed ceramics introduced to China in the fourteenth century via maritime trade and Thai envoys sent to China, who brought celadon wares back with them after providing tribute to the Ming court- although Thai tradition attributes the development of celadon to Chinese refugees who arrived in Thailand after the collapse of the Song dynasty in 1279.  

Demonstrating a range of Chinese, Khmer and Vietnamese influences, celadon wares from Sawankhalok are nevertheless distinctly Thai in their choice of motifs and shapes, with a characteristic soft green tone achieved by applying green glaze over a white slip. They became popular export items in the fifteenth century, as Thai kilns took advantage of disruptions to production in China to send their ceramics to the Indonesian Archipelago, Malay Peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia. Sawankhalok celadon comprises a major part of the cargo of the mid- fifteenth century Royal Nanhai, the wreck of a Siamese junk heading for Java that was carrying over 20,000 ceramic items. They appear to have been the dominant form of Southeast Asian celadon until around 1488, when they were supplanted by Burmese examples.
