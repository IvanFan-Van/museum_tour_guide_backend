# Jar  

China (Southern Song dynasty), 1127- 1279 Porcelain with white- green glaze,  $7.1 \times 10 \mathrm{cm}$  HKU.C.1994.1001  

This qinghai jar is modelled after woven rattan or willow containers called liudou (‘willow jars’) used in agriculture to measure grains. Imitations of these jars were produced from the Tang period onwards, initially in metal and later in earthenware and stoneware. Few qinghai jars in these shapes are known, though ceramic liudou with other glazes were sometimes produced at kilns in Yaozhou and Ganzhou, the latter including a notable example recovered from the Sinan wreck, a Chinese cargo vessel that sank off the Sinan coast of Korea in 1323 on a voyage to ports in Korea, Japan and presumably Southeast Asia.  

In the Song dynasty, educated men demonstrated their cultural refinement by collecting objects from the past and publishing catalogues illustrating historical jades and bronzes. Contemporary Song craftsmen responded to this behavior by reproducing antiquarian forms in other materials, often in the form of commissions for wealthy clients. New users adapted the functions of these objects to suit their needs. This jar was most likely used for burning incense as for offering food to deceased ancestors, rather than as an agricultural tool.
