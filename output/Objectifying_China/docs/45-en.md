# Mounted bowl  

Jingdezhen, China, Kangxi period, 1662- 1722; mounts added in the Netherlands, late 17th century Porcelain with underglaze blue and ormolu mounts, 15.2 x 21.5 cm Asian Civilisations Museum, 2014- 00433  

Exotic and highly valued, early porcelain in Europe was perceived in the same way as natural curiosities like ostrich eggs, serpentine and coconuts, and like those materials was sometimes ornamented with expensive mounts chosen to enhance its value. Because of their rarity and cost, these early mounted porcelains were confined to royalty and a few aristocratic families, where they were used as attractive sideboards or displayed in kunstkammer (cabinets of curiosities in German).  

After the Dutch and British East India companies entered the trade in Chinese ceramics in the seventeenth century, and porcelain became available to a growing middle- class, the practice of mounting these objects with precious metals continued as a means of demonstrating wealth and luxury. Their presence in numerous Dutch and Flemish still life paintings of the early seventeenth century attests to their popularity.  

Mounted porcelain took various forms, from small blue- and- white bowls and ewers to large celadon vases and pots. This bowl was made for export at Jingdezhen, with the mounts added later, probably in the Netherlands. The exterior features an openwork honeycomb and flower- head pattern, revealing a body decorated with underglaze blue floral sprays beneath. Double- walled objects with a pierced outer wall like this bowl are called linglong (devil's work') in China due to the time and effort it takes to produce them.
