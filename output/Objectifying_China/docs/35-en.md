Crudely potted and decorated on the interior with an egret surrounded by flowers, this bowl was probably made in Zhangzhou, an important porcelain production centre and port in the south of Fujian province, or smaller nearby coastal kilns. Characterised by thick porcelain filled with impurities decorate with simple designs, scholars originally called wares of this type Swatow, after an old Dutch transliteration of Shantou, a port in northern Guangdong province that was mistakenly believed to have been the port from which they were shipped. Excavations in the 1990s revealed several major kiln sites in Zhangzhou that produced these wares in the late sixteenth and mid- seventeenth centuries; they are generally now referred to as Zhangzhou wares.  

Valued as much as highly- finished Jingdezhen porcelain in parts of Southeast Asia, Zhangzhou wares were primarily made for export to the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. They were also desired by European traders for the high prices they commanded in the intra- Asian trade. They were made in a variety of shapes, though surviving examples from shipwrecks like the Witter Leeuw, a Dutch ship that sank in 1613 near St. Helena, suggest that large dishes, bowls, covered boxes, jars and small plates were the most popular forms.

10. The term Swatow was apparently introduced by antique dealers and collectors, but it is not clear when the use of the term started. Robert Hobson (1872-1941), former keeper of the Asian Department of the British Museum and author of one of the earliest and most important works on these objects, The Wares of the Ming Dynasty (Hobson 1923), did not use the term Swatow, nor did officials of the Dutch East India Company, who instead referred to them as grof (coarse) wares.
