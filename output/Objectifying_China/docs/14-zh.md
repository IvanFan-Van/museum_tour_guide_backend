# Plate  

China (Qing dynasty), Daoguang period, 1821- 1850 Porcelain with blue underglaze and overglaze enamels, diameter  $17.5\mathrm{cm}$  HKU.C.1978.0637  

This plate depicts a red five- clawed dragon writhing in mid- air above blue swirling waves. The colour combination was achieved by painting waves in cobalt oxide under a clear glaze and firing the clay at a high temperature. Red enamels were applied later and fused on in a subsequent, low- temperature dring, to regain against eroding. Red were popular designs from the Ming dynasty onward, and underglaze- blue and red examples can be found with reign marks of nearly all the Qing emperors.
