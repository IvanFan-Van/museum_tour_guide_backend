# Bowl  

Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), early or mid- 15th century Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter 20.8 cm HKU.C.2003.1485  

The base of this bowl is painted with the reign marks of the Xuande emperor, but in its shape and design it is closely related to a group of Chenghua period blue- and- white porcelain bowls formerly in the collection of the Tsui Museum of Art. The Tsui bowls are similarly marked Xuande, but were unearthed from Chenghua period strata at imperial kiln sites in Jingdezhen. They represent the earliest known examples of reign marks from a previous era being inscribed on pieces of imperial porcelainâ€”a practice that later became widespread as a mark of respect and to acknowledge the borrowing of designs. Lions playing with beribboned balls on the exterior carry auspicious associations of physical and spiritual power and wishes for high rank.

8. The Tsui Museum of Art housed the collection of Hong Kong businessman T.T. Tsui, who began collecting in the 1970s. Tsui donated a significant portion of his collection to UMAG and the Hong Kong Heritage Museum, as well as to numerous institutions in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.
