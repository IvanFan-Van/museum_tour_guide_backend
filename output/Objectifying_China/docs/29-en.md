# Covered jar  

Covered jarNorthern Vietnam, 14th century Stoneware, height 12.8 cm Asian Civilisations Museum, 2000- 01239  

This jar includes moulded decorations of floral scrolls applied to the outer wall. The base is incised with three characters: tian, chang and kou (literally 'heaven', 'long' and 'mouth'). It is typical of the high- quality celadon produced in northern Vietnam during the Tran dynasty (1225- 1400). Like potters in Thailand during the so- called Ming gap, Vietnamese kilns along the banks of the Red River began exporting ceramics to Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia and Japan to fill the vacuum left by the trade with China from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. The output of these kilns reflected contemporary stylistic changes in the Middle Kingdom, as the popularity of ivory- and celadon- glazed vessels soon yielded te ceramics with painted decoration in iron brown or cobalt blue.
