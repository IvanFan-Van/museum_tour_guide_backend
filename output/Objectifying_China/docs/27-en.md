# Miniature bowl  

Sawankhalok, Thailand, 15th or 16th century Stoneware with celadon glaze, height 4.3 cm HKU.C.1964.0583  

Miniature objects such as figurines, jarlets, cups and bottles were used in local Thai ritual practices, sometimes in association with small portable shrines. Like these examples, they were often decorated with pale olive- green crackled glaze, with their lower sections left unglazed to show their brownish- red bodies. Miniatures were the most common type of celadon wares manufactured at the Sawankhalok kilns, and were produced both for domestic consumption and for export.
