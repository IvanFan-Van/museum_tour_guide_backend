# Foreword  

The early modern era was marked by the extension of the Silk Road to Italy and by the beginning of the importation into Europe of Eastern goods in the fourteenth century. Porcelain from China—the first country in the world to produce high- fired, glazed ceramics—was one of the most important elements of this trade, which in the sixteenth century had expanded to include vast quantities of tea, silk, lacquer, spices and opium.  

This catalogue and its accompanying exhibition tell the story of this trade, exploring how ceramics from different regions, particularly China and Europe, spread styles, forms and manufacturing technologies across the globe, and in the process dramatically altered the course of European and Asian art.  

While we place particular importance on early Ming dynasty blue- and- white porcelain pieces that reached the Ducal court of the Medicis in Florence, and early export goods in the Low Countries, our chronological display begins much earlier, with a rare Tang dynasty blue- and- white water pot and a Yuan dynasty bottle—both from time periods that predate better- known Ming production. These ceramics highlight the artistic quality and beauty of Chinese wares, as well as their influence, appreciation and imitation abroad.  

This international theme is further explored by presenting Ming and Qing dynasty objects that were made for local consumption in China, as well as for export alongside local responses to these wares in Europe, East Asia and Southeast Asia. In so doing, we move beyond the better- known influences of export to the West by including regional varieties of, for example, celadon ware in Korea and Thailand.  

We would like to thank our exhibition partners, the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Hong Kong Maritime Museum for their generous loans, and for their assistance in organising related public programming and publications. As with all UMAG exhibitions, our mission is to engage with audiences through the discussion of materials and techniques, as well as historic and cross- cultural exchanges. We express our gratitude to Robert Black College, The University of Hong Kong, for support of the exhibition on their 50th anniversary.
