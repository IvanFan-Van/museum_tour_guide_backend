Lavishly painted and gilded porcelain services of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, usually decorated with outdoor scenes of noble men and women, are sometimes called 'palace ware'. The name was first used by collectors in New York, Boston and Philadelphia in the 1930s to refer to their ostentatious detail and subject matter. Late export porcelain of this type was typically made, glazed and fired at Jingdezhen but decorated in Canton, from where it was shipped to Europe and America.  

These custard cups are part of a larger dinner service of dishes, plates, sauces, platters, tureens, bowls and cups suitable for a grand interior. Each object is decorated with a central scene in the famille roe palette showing different men and women among pavilions and mountainous landscapes. The scenes are surrounded by several painted and gilded borders with geometric and floral patterns, interrupted by small panels showing birds, flowers and landscapes in iron- red or sepia.  

This design has been referred to as the 'Rockefeller pattern' since 1979, due to its association with the famous Rockefeller family of New York, John D. Rockefeller, Jr (1874- 1946), son and heir of the dynasty's founder, owned a dessert service with the pattern. Prior to being acquired by the Rockefellers, the service was owned and probably commissioned by Charles Stirling, a wealthy Scottish landowner involved in the China trade. Another service of the same design is known to have been ordered by John Roberts (1739- 1810), a Director of the British East India Company, likely around 1805. The gradual dissemination of these services through inheritance and sale accounts for the presence of many individual pieces in different collections today.  

The famille roe palette used to paint the central scenes was developed in China during the late Kangxi period by Jesuit priests working with craftsmen at the Yangxindian (Hall of Mental Cultivation) within the Forbidden City. It is characterised by soft pinks and reds created by mixing ruby red (derived from colloidal gold) and opaque white enamel, which allowed for a great range of tones and shades. Its development in China was roughly contemporaneous with rose du barry enamels invented in France in the eighteenth century, named after the Comtesse du Barry, mistress to Louis XV (1710- 1774) and a patron of the Sevres porcelain factory.
