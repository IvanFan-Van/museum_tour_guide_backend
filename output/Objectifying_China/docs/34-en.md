# Bowl  

Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), late 15th or early 16th century Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter  $14.8cm$  HKUC.1978.0659  

This thickly potted bowl is decorated with a honeycomb pattern and stylised lotus panels in pale blue. Inside, a large central medallion with a double vajra (a Buddhist motif that takes the form of a club with a ribbed spherical head) is framed by a string of pearls on the sides. The compact, hard porcelain bowl is more grey than white, with a blue- tinged glaze that contains numerous bubbles.  

Bowls of this type were mass- produced at Jingdezhen in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century, a period marked by a sudden outflow of Chinese blue and- white ceramics to Southeast Asia. Several factors contributed to this fluff of activity in during a change in commercial industry which had developed as a response to reduced imperial porcelain production between 1435 and 1461, and the ensuing environment of economic and political stability during the reigns of the Chenghua and Hongzhi emperors.  

Similar bowls intended for Southeast Asia from this period have been found in shipwrecks off the coast of Indonesia and the Philippines, such as a nearby identical example recovered from a Chinese junk that sunk off the Lena Bowl ca. 1490- 1500, now in the Ambassador and Mrs Charles Muller collection. They were also sent to Persia, where the honeycomb pattern was prominently used on fritware dishes made in Tabriz and other important cultural centres.
