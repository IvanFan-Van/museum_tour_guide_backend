Together with figurines and serving vessels, the kilns at Dehua produced a variety of small porcelain objects for the scholar's desk. Both decorative and functional, they expressed the sophistication and connoisseurship of their owners and were sometimes used in the composition of literary works and paintings. Their shapes, often inspired by the natural world, provided philosophical and moral inspiration to scholars through their symbolic content. The shape of this brush washer, for example, imitates lotus leaves, which are traditional symbols of purity in Chinese culture because they rise out of the mud to bloom.  

Leaf- shaped brush washers from Dehua appear to have inspired the production of small cups for sherbet and hot beverages in Europe. The first examples were made at Meissen in 1711 in red gris, but later hard- paste white porcelain wares with tin- glazes were produced across Europe. They were a specialty of the manufactory at Doccia, Italy, where notable examples were made from 1766 until the end of the eighteenth century.
