# Guanyin figure  

Dehua, China (Qing dynasty), Kangxi period, 1662- 1722 Porcelain with ivory glaze, height 23.5 cm HKU.C.1953.0014  

Likely made for domestic use and worshipped on a small household altar, the figure represents the Chinese Guanyin, a bodhisattva ('enlightened being'), sitting on a rock in the 'royal ease' position. Her body is dressed in loosely fitting robes that fall open at the chest, revealing a lotus- shaped pendant and leaving only her right foot uncovered. The head, slightly lowered, bears a jewelled crown placed on neatly arranged hair in a high chignon, all covered by a cowl. Moulded in different sections, the exterior is fully covered by a white glaze with a slightly blueish hue, leaving only the base rim and the interior uncovered.  

Guanyin, the bodhisattva of compassion, is one of the most popular Buddhist figures in China. She originated in India as the male bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, who was transformed after the introduction of Buddhism into China (through a process that is not well understood) into a female bodhisattva associated with the virtues of compassion and mercy. Guanyin was also worshipped as the patron of fishermen, and by women as a fertility goddess and 'bringer of sons'.  

Early images of a cowled female bodhisattva, dating from the Song dynasty, have been found at the ancient Buddhist cave shrines of Maijishan (cave 165), Gansu province and Dazu (cave 136) in Chongqing. From the seventeenth century onwards, the porcelain kilns at Dehua were celebrated for their production of Buddhist models, amongst which Guanyin figures were prominent. They appear to have been the most popular figural subjects during the reign of the Wanli emperor through to the end of the Qing dynasty.
