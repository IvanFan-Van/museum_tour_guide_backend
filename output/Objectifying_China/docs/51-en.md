# Bowl with brown glaze  

Jingdezhen, China (Qing dynasty), Qianlong period, 1736- 1795 Porcelain with underglaze blue and brown glaze, diameter 18.5 cm HKUC.1987.0914  

Large quantities of bowls and dishes with underglaze blue decoration on the interior and deep brown glazes on the exterior were produced in Jingdezhen during the early eighteenth century, when the fashion for Chinese porcelain was at its highest in Europe. Made by adding high concentrations of iron oxide (usually in the form of iron filings) to the glaze during the firing process, porcelain wares of this type were referred to as Batavian ware, after the major Dutch port in Indonesia through which they were shipped.  

A visitor to the Qing court, the French Jesuit priest Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles described porcelains of this type as tse- kin (golden brown) in letters sent to his superiors in 1712 and 1723. He observed that they were on the main wares manufactured for the Qing court on a regular basis, and a recent inventionâ€”though the long history of brown glazes in China suggests that he was referring specifically to technical processes used in the early eighteenth century rather than brown- glazed porcelain in general.  

These wares were particularly popular in the Netherlands, although significant quantities recovered from the foundered Swedish East Indiaman Gothervg (sunk 1745) demonstrate that they were also exported to Northern Europe in large quantities. They were shipped to America after it entered the China trade in 1784, and the decoration was later revived in the early nineteenth century, primarily on wares intended for export to Southeast Asia. This bowl was recovered from the Nanking cargo, the wreck of a Dutch East India Company ship which left Canton in December 1751 with more than 230,000 pieces of porcelain, textiles and tea for the European market.
