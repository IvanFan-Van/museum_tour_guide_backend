# Vase and plate  

Jingdezhen, China (Qing dynasty) Kangxi period, 1662- 1722 Porcelain with powder blue glaze, gilding and overglaze enamels, height  $43.3\mathrm{cm}$  diameter  $27~\mathrm{cm}$  HKU.C.1954.0136, HKU.C.1976.0623  

The speckled blue surface of these objects, called powder blue, was created by blowing cobalt blue through a bamboo tube onto unfired porcelain, a technique that was perfected in the Kangxi period. On wares like this, specially shaped resists were used to create blank areas, which were subsequently painted in overglaze enamels and then fired a second time. A third firing fixed gilded designs onto the surface of the blue ground.  

The complex three- stage decoration and firing of such objects made them luxurious and expensive export items. They were often decorated with figure and objects that European consumers found appealing, such as a slender Chinese lady depicted in several panels on the vase. In the Dutch language she was called Lange Lijs, which became 'Long Eliza' in English. One of the most popular designs on export wares from the Kangxi period, the design was widely imitated in European porcelain, particularly on plates and bowls from Worcester in the 1760s.
