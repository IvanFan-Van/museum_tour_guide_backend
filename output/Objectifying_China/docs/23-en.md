# Bowl with parrots  

Bowl with parrotsKorea (Goryeo dynasty), 918â€“1392Stoneware with celadon glaze, diameter 20 cmHKU.C.1961.0247  

Ceramics with green glazes were the only high- fired wares produced in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty. First introduced from China around the tenth century, by the middle of the twelfth century Korean potters had developed their own distinctive traditions with shapes and designs that reflected native tastes. These Korean wares were extolled in contemporaneous Chinese writings as having the 'clarity of water' and the 'radiance of jade'.  

The interior of this bowl is finely incised with two long- tailed parrots, positioned as if chasing each other. The patterns were carved with a knife, a technique known as emgukak chengja (incised celadon), which flourished in Korea during the twelfth century. The brown hue of the glaze is likely the result of poor control of oxygen levels during the firing process. On the base, three small spur marks are the remnants of sand, pebbles or shells commonly used to raise ceramic vessels off the kiln floor, so as to prevent their bases from picking up residue or being deformed.
