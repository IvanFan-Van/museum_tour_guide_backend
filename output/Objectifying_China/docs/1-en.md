The pictorial decoration on these objects resembles literati- style landscape paintings. Incredibly detailed, the designs demonstrate the sophisticated porcelain enamelling techniques developed during the reign of the Kangxi emperor. A great supporter of the arts, Kangxi initiated major efforts to rebuild the kilns at Jingdezhen, which had been destroyed in 1674 by Minna rebels. The emperor encouraged potters at the newly- rebuilt kilns to push technological limits, resulting in large, finely potted ceramics with complex polychrome designs.  

Common subjects for such objects include historical characters modelled after illustrations in woodblock- print plays and novels. Literati themes were also popular, such as the scene of scholars enjoying leisurely activities depicted on the brush pot, or the scholarly objects and antiques depicted in panels on the second vase.
