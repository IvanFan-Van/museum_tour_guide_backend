# Jardinière  

Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), Jiajing period, 1522- 1566 Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter  $72.3\mathrm{cm}$  HKU.C.1996.1093  

This immense ceramic is a jardinière, made as a decorative display or water container for the gardens of a Chinese villa. The main pattern depicts awkward- looking twin lions with sharp claws playing with ornamental balls. A prominent inscription at the centre reads: Da Ming Jiajing Nian Zhi—Manufactured in the Reign of Jiajing of the Great Ming Dynasty.  

Because of their weight, large objects like this were particularly difficult to manufacture, often warping during the firing process. By some accounts, they required up to nine days to fire, with frequent misfires. The almost purple colour of the decoration is the result of mixing imported cobalt blue with lead, which from Parishews called chisteria. A mixture of living porcelains, it was generally only used on jardinières reserved for the imperial court, noble families or high- ranking officials.  

Auspicious patterns like the twin lions sporting ornamental balls were popular during the reign of the Jiajing emperor, a result of his interest in Daosum, alchemy and Xiangrui ('auspicious signs'). The rest of the designs in the gardinière are similarly loaded with symbolism: the cloud motifs are variation of the ruyi ('wish- granting wand') design. The grouping of these images represents a common device in Chinese art: the use of homophones to create visual puns. For example, the words for 'lion' and 'things' are both pronounced shi in Chinese. The combination of twin lions and cloud patterns therefore refers to the blessing of shizhi ruyi ('wishes for all things will be granted').  

Europeans who acquired Chinese porcelain likely had little understanding of this complex visual language, but enjoyed the pleasing colour, exotic subject matter, minute detail and technical achievement of such objects. The unusual creatures and unfamiliar landscapes also undoubtedly contributed to a European vision of the East that found expression in fantastical art movements such as Chinoiserie and Japonisme.
