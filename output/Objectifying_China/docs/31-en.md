# Tankard  

Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), early 15th century Porcelain with underglaze blue, height  $13.3\mathrm{cm}$  HKU.C.1957.0193  

The unusual shape of this tankard derives from containers introduced to China by traders from the Islamic world during the Yuan dynasty. The same form, but lacking a handle, is known in twelfth, thirteenth- and fourteenth- century Islamic metalwork, while examples with handles appear in Persian and Persian dynasty 479. Chinese metal work is often featured in the Yuan dynasty at the imperial kiln complex in Jingdezhen.  

Successful both domestically and as export items sent to the Middle East, the continued to be produced into the reigns of the Yongle and Xuande emperors. Clearly treasured possessions in successive dynasties, a similar tankard displayed on a wooden stand is illustrated in the gw wan tu (pictures of ancient playthings') handscroll in the Victoria and Albert Museum; a form of pictorial inventory of the palace collections made in 1729 for the Yongzheng emperor.  

Europeans admired the exotic profiles of Chinese porcelains inspired by objects from the Middle East. After arriving in Europe, often via the Netherlands, tankards were sometimes mounted with silver- gilt covers and stands. Later on, seventeenth- century versions of these tankards from Arita were even made with pre- formed holes in the handles to facilitate the addition of mounts.
