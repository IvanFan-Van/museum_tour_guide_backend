# Bowl  

Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), Yongle period, 1403- 1424 Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter  $20.5\mathrm{cm}$  HKU.C.2003.1484  

A period of cultural restoration and expansion, the Ming period swept away much that was associated with the defeated Yuan dynasty, but blue- and- white porcelain survived and prospered. Bowls with floral patterns in the form of peonies or lotus flowers were among the most popular, and were made in various numbers for the imperial court and for export to the Middle East, where they were preserved in royal Safavid, Mughal and Ottoman collections. Marked examples were strictly reserved for the use of the imperial household and as tributary gifts.  

Painted using different shades of blue to suggest volume, the decoration on this bowl depicts a narrative with building tea girls, with a border of emplaced lotus scrolls on the interior. The naturalistic depiction of the floral motifs, open design and the rich colour of the cobalt (which is fired to a dark deep blue in some parts and pale blue in others), are typical features of Yongle- emporcelain.
