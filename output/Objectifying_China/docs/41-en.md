# Klapmut's bowl  

Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), early 17th century Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter 15 cm HKU.C.1966.0301  

The central scene on this bowl features an eagle standing on a rock surrounded by trees. Imagery like this is common in Chinese art, much of it drawn from the bird- and- flower painting genre that developed in the Song dynasty, and which found later expression on ceramics and other materials. Associated with boldness, strength and heroism, the eagle shown on a rock may represent a hero standing alone, a subject known on a number of earlier sixteenth- century export wares made at the Zhangzhou kilns in Fujian for export to Southeast Asia.  

The central image is surrounded by a reserve panel pattern typical of kraak porcelain. Alternative panels contain leaves shaped forms with a variety of auspicious symbols, such as a double gourd (representative of good fortune), leaf (felicity), peach (immortality) and pomegranate (fertility). Above the lozenges are triangular fields showing animal faces. Unlike typical panelled borders found on kraak, each element is unique and none are repeated.  

Deep bowls with flattened rims were a characteristic export shape. Designed as soup bowls, the wide rim was intended to accommodate large metal spoons that were not used in China. Many examples were made for the Dutch marks, often called klapmutsâ€”the Dutch word for fashionable seventeenth- century hats of the same shape. Klapmut's bowls appear extensively in Dutch East India Company shipping records, as well as in paintings, the earliest dating to 1601.
