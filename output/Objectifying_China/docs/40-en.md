# Kraak plate  

Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), Chongzhen period, 1628- 1644 Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter 23 cm Hong Kong Maritime Museum, HKMM2014.0010.0001  

The border of decorative panels on this plate is a distinctive feature of thinly potted porcelains called kraak ware that came to dominate the export trade in the seventeenth century. Mass produced from the late Wanli period for export within Asia as well as to Europe, kraak likely takes its name from the Dutch term for Portuguese merchant ships called caracca, which first brought these wares to the West. Early interest in kraak in the Netherlands was stimulated by the Dutch capture of two Portuguese carcass in 1602 and 1604, whose cargoes were filled with thousands of pieces of kraak ware that were later auctioned off. They were widely depicted in early seventeenth- century Dutch paintings, such as still lifes by Floris van Dijck (1575- 1621) and Osias Beert (ca. 1900- 1625).  

Standard shapes for kraak included bowls, cups and dishes, as well as more specifically Western forms like butter dishes, mustard pots, saltc ellars and wine pots. Deep, un- rimmed bowls and dishes were probably based on earlier Chinese porcelain shapes, while Western forms required the use of pewter, wood or silver models, which Dutch East India Company agents in China ordered regularly. Kraak wares could be of low or extremely fine quality, the latter usually the result of orders made by private traders for special clients. Large plates or chargers were among the most expensive items in European inventories, while smaller examples like this plate from the Hatcher cargo (a Chinese junk that sank near Batavia in 1643) were more affordable.
