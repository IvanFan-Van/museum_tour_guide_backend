# Bowl  

China (Qing dynasty), late 17th or early 18th century Porcelain with overglaze enamels,  $8.6 \times 19 \mathrm{cm}$  HKU.C.1972.0432  

The introduction of a brilliant translucent green enamel to the existing wacai palette of yellow, red, green, aubergine and underglaze blue was an important innovation in the development of polychromes porcelain. Wares decorated in several shades of green were particularly prized at the imperial court in Beijing. Their smooth, clear glazes and sophisticated decoration also found wide appeal in the courts of Europe in the seventeenth century. This bowl is decorated with a well- known design from that period, showing horses, flowers and auspicious emblems against a green background of swirling waves.  

The crests of the waves and some of the horses have been intentionally left without enamel, revealing the white body of the porcelain below.  

Porcelain with predominantly green and yellow designs came to be known as famille verte in the West in the late nineteenth century. Auction records and inventories of the time are littered with references to vases, figures and animals decorated in these colours, and the collector and academic Robert Hobson attested to their popularity in his early catalogues of Chinese ceramic in the British Museum. Major antiquarians of this era, including George Salting, Ernest Grandjier and Anthony de Rothschild, are known to have amassed significant quantities for their private collections.
