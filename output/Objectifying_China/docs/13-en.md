# Bowl with doucai enamels  

Jingdezhen, China (Qing dynasty), Daoguang period, 1821- 1850 Porcelain with underglaze blue and overglaze enamels, diameter  $13.8\mathrm{cm}$  HKU.C.2009.1809  

Like wccai, doucai (fitted- colour) porcelains are decorated with a combination of underglaze blue and overglaze enamels. However, while on wccai porcelain underglaze dark blue is applied in bold washes to complement strong overglaze colours, usually within outlines in red, brown or black, doucai porcelain features pale enamel washes with outlines in soft underglaze blue. Developed during the reign of the Xuande emperor, the technique was perfected in the Chenghua period. It has been used to great effect on this bowl to depict mandarin ducks in a lotus pond, framed by a band of stylised, possibly Sanskrit, characters on the rim.  

Since they were mistakenly thought to mate for life, pairs of mandarin ducks are an auspicious symbol for a happy marriage in China. When accompanied by lotuses, homophonous in Chinese with the word for harmony (he), they may also be interpreted as expressing the wish for many sons, and ceramic pairing the two motifs have their origins in the decorative arts of the Tang dynasty. Similar designs were used on Yuan dynasty blue- and- white dishes are enamelled ceramic from the Ming dynasty, as well as kraak wares made for export to Europe. They also appear to have been a popular adornment for Ming jardini√®res, used as aquaria and to grow water plants.

14. The earliest enamelled porcelains with ducks and lotus flowers alternating in a row on the exterior appear to date to the Jiajing period, such as an iron-red, green and yellow bowl from the British Museum illustrated in Harrison-Hall 2001, no. 9:101.
